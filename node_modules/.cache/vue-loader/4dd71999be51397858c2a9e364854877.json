In fact, researchers at Anglia Ruskin University have discovered that feeling \\u201changry\\u201d, a portmanteau of hungry and angry, really exists. Being hungry was associated with greater levels of anger and irritability, as well as lower levels of pleasure. So how do we get a handle on our hunger? Here are three easy ways to regulate your appetite.\", \"1. Pack in the protein\", \"Satiety is the salient word here, or rather how satisfied or full we are after eating and how long that feeling lasts. Food is made up of three macronutrients: protein, fat and carbohydrate, and there is consistent evidence that protein is the most effective at keeping us full for longer. Studies have shown that protein-rich diets decrease the production of the hunger hormone ghrelin. High protein foods include eggs, lean meat and poultry, fish, dairy, soy, legumes, nuts and seeds. \", \"To get a hit of protein off the bat, try this protein-rich breakfast smoothie. In a blender, place 150g cottage cheese, 100g frozen berries, \\u00bd ripe banana, \\u00bc ripe avocado, 1 tbsp ground flaxseed, 2 tsp honey and 200ml milk.

A reduction in stomach acid, a condition known as atrophic gastritis which leads to poor absorption of vitamins and minerals, is estimated to affect 20 per cent of the population over the age of 65. And this matters because micronutrient deficiencies can increase our risk of disease. \", \"Indeed, a new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that participants with low levels of vitamin D were 54 per cent more prone to dementia than those with normal vitamin D levels. Deficiencies in other key micronutrients have also been linked to age-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease and some cancers. \", \"Here are three easy ways to help your body absorb more nutrients from your food.\", \"1. Careful how you cook\", \"Some micronutrients are water-soluble and heat sensitive, especially the B vitamins and vitamin C. The latter can be reduced by as much as 50 per cent by boiling. Steaming vegetables, on the other hand, only reduces the vitamin C content by 15 per cent and microwaving by 20 per cent. Stir-frying is another good option as there is no water involved and the cooking time is generally quite short. B vitamins are abundant in meat but up to 60 per cent can be lost when cooked and the juices run out, so be sure the cooking juices are poured back over the meat when rested.\", \"Conversely, cooking can increase the level of some other nutrients. Lycopene, a plant compound with antioxidant properties, increases by 25 per cent when tomatoes are cooked, and the bioavailability (the extent to which a nutrient can be absorbed by the body) of beta-carotene, found in red, orange and yellow plants like tomatoes, peppers, carrots and sweet potatoes, is also increased by cooking. These vegetables lend themselves very well to roasting in the oven \\u2013 drizzle with olive oil, season well and roast for 30 minutes at 200C.\", \"2. Cut up fruit and vegetables but keep the skins on\", \"Cutting up raw fruits and vegetables just before eating helps break down the cell walls, which makes the nutrients contained within the cells more easily available. For example, crushing garlic releases a compound called allicin, which can help lower cholesterol and blood-pressure levels. If food is cooked, it\\u2019s better to cut it up after cooking as less will have been exposed to heat and water, which can reduce the nutrient content. And don\\u2019t peel fruit and veg unless you have to, as fewer nutrients will be lost if the skins are kept on.\", \"3. Play food pairs\", \"The bioavailability of certain nutrients is increased when paired with other foods. For example, vitamins A, D, E and K (found in a wide-range of foods) are fat-soluble, so including healthy fats like nuts, avocado or olive oil in our meals is important to ensure they are absorbed. \", \"To increase your uptake of iron from foods like red meat, leafy greens, shellfish and legumes, pair with vitamin C from berries, citrus fruit, tomatoes and peppers. And vitamin D \\u2013 which we mainly get from the sun on our skin but which is also found in oily fish, eggs and mushrooms \\u2013 aids the absorption of calcium, found in dairy products, tofu and leafy green vegetables. \", \"A good example of food pairing is this hot-smoked salmon p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, which has vitamin D from the oily fish and calcium from the Greek yogurt. In a bowl, mash one packet of hot-smoked salmon fillets with 2 tbsp Greek yogurt, 2 spring onions (finely sliced) and the juice of \\u00bd lemon.

However, even Bridge was shocked by figures showing that more than a million prescriptions for antidepressants are now written for teenagers in England each year, with NHS data confirming that the number of drugs doled out to 13 to 19-year-olds has risen by a quarter between 2016 and 2020.\", \"Child mental health services are reported to be \\u201cat breaking point\\u201d, with referrals up by 52 per cent last year and some parents even admitting that they have been sleeping outside their children\\u2019s bedrooms in order to check they are not self-harming.

Indeed the \\u201cempty calories contained in some feelings\\u201d have only helped our \\u201csense of self-importance to grow fat\\u201d, she says.

It showed that those who were socially isolated had poorer cognition, including in memory and reaction time, while different parts of their brains appeared to have shrunk in volume.

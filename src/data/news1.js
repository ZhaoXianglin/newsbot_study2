                    "China Renaissance said its missing founder Bao Fan was “co-operating in an investigation” with Chinese authorities, more than a week after the investment bank disclosed it had been unable to contact him.",
                    "In a terse exchange filing on Sunday in Hong Kong, the company said its board had “become aware that Mr Bao is currently co-operating in an investigation being carried out by certain authorities in the People’s Republic of China”.",
                    "The disappearance of Bao, a former Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse banker famed for wheeling and dealing on behalf of the most powerful corporate groups in China’s technology sector, has cast a pall over the industry just as Beijing appeared set to draw a line under a protracted regulatory crackdown.",
                    "Bao rose to prominence through China Renaissance, founding the boutique tech investment firm in 2005 to provide initial public offering and other capital markets services to the country’s rising tech stars.",
                    "The board of the investment bank said its operations “are continuing normally”. It added the company “will duly co-operate and assist with any lawful request from the relevant PRC authorities, if and when made”.",
                    "Hong Kong-listed shares in China Renaissance rose 3.4 per cent on Monday on the new information concerning Bao. However the stock is still down more than 26 per cent since the company revealed on February 16 that it was unable to contact Bao, the face of the investment bank and its main rainmaker thanks to his personal relationships with many of China’s tech billionaires.",
                    "The steady business provided by those ties has dried up in recent years as regulatory scrutiny of the sector ramped up shortly after ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing’s botched New York listing, on which China Renaissance served as bookrunner.",
                    "Didi pushed ahead with its $4.4bn share sale in 2021 despite national security concerns from regulators. The group was forced to delist in June last year.",
                    "Bao’s involvement in a government investigation makes him the second executive at China Renaissance to be summoned by authorities in relation to an official probe.",
                    "In September, China’s securities regulator called in Cong Lin, the bank’s president and head of its securities unit, for a “supervisory discussion”. Cong exited key positions at the securities unit within days and was detained by Chinese authorities around that time.",
                    "Cong was hired by China Renaissance after playing a key role in a strategic partnership between the investment bank and ICBC International, a division of China’s state-run bank ICBC.",
                    "As part of the partnership, announced in 2017, ICBC International provided a $200mn credit line to China Renaissance backed by pledged shares in the investment bank, with the stipulation that the funds be paid back soon after its Hong Kong listing.",

                    "Times are tough in the global cryptocurrency business. Following a series of industry disasters capped by November's collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, regulators around the world have been cracking down on the sector.",
                    "But there is one intriguing exception to this trend in Asia. In recent months, Hong Kong, a financial center seeking to maintain its prominence in the face of growing competition from Singapore, has been mounting an aggressive campaign to become a crypto hub.",
                    "Last week, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission proposed a licensing regime for crypto trading that could allow retail dealings in digital tokens, while the government dedicated 50 million Hong Kong dollars ($6.4 million) in its annual budget to developing \"Web3\" businesses operating on blockchains, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies. The previous week, the government issued HK$800 million of green bonds as digital tokens -- a first of its kind globally.",
                    "Digital-asset industry participants say they are feeling more at home in the Chinese territory. Justin Sun, a leading crypto entrepreneur, even told Nikkei Asia last week that he was planning to move his base of operations from Singapore to Hong Kong.",
                    "\"The message is clear, that the [SFC] would like to understand more about the market ... and to make it more friendly,\" said Ken Lo, co-founder of Hong Kong crypto exchange HKbitEX. \"I think they have the willingness to change.\"",
                    "The Asian financial hub has not always been so welcoming to the crypto crowd. In 2018, it introduced rules limiting crypto trading to institutional investors, sparking an exodus of digital startups to Singapore and other less strictly regulated jurisdictions. Three years later, China followed with an outright ban on cryptocurrencies on the mainland.",
                    "Last October, however, as much of crypto industry was melting down, Hong Kong authorities reversed course and announced their goal of becoming Asia's crypto capital, kicking off a public consultation period on whether to allow retail crypto trading and permit crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs).",
                    "There are now three crypto ETFs that deal in crypto futures on offer in Hong Kong, and the SFC said last week that it was considering allowing retail trading of Bitcoin and Ether on licensed platforms.",
                    "The argument being made by Hong Kong authorities is that their reputation for rigor in regulating crypto has positioned them to oversee the industry as it works to recover. \"As certain crypto exchanges collapsed one after another, Hong Kong became a quality standing point for digital-asset corporates,\" Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in January at a Web3 forum.",
                    "Donald Day, a former SFC digital asset expert, said Hong Kong authorities tightened their rules when \"the virtual asset market structure was a lot less mature than it is now (and) prices fluctuated with high volatility.\" While acknowledging that prices remain volatile and \"the underlying asset class is technically complex,\" Day said, \"the fact that the Hong Kong framework is largely unchanged since its inception provides stability and strategic security for entities to set up and operate their business in Hong Kong.\"",
                    "The contrast with other financial centers is striking. Since the start of the year, U.S. authorities have unveiled a slew of enforcement actions targeting leading crypto players and rolled out tougher rules for safeguarding customer assets. Singapore has proposed regulations, expected to be rolled out this year, that would tighten rules for retail investors, banning the use of credit for crypto trading.",
                    "The timing of Hong Kong's pivot has also raised eyebrows. Prices for Bitcoin and other digital tokens have gained ground in recent weeks but they remain far below their 2021 highs and many industry players remain downbeat, expecting further layoffs at digital-asset operations.",
                    "Hong Kong's crypto charm offensive comes at it seeks to rebuild its international image after nearly three years of harsh coronavirus restrictions and a sweeping national security law that eroded confidence in the city and undermined its status as a global financial hub.",
                    "In contrast with those dark days, Hong Kong is now rolling out a digital-asset welcome mat, hosting several Web3 events this year for investors and entrepreneurs. Larger-scale events including the WOW summit will be held later this year.",
                    "\"The atmosphere and the leadership's foresight fuels our optimism for the city's future as a digital-assets hub,\" said Jonathan Cheong, head of legal risk and compliance at crypto exchange Bybit.",
                    "Hong Kong officials are seen as particularly interested in regaining ground lost to Singapore. Between July 2021 and June 2022, crypto trading volume in Singapore was a little more than $100 billion, compared with $74 billion in Hong Kong, according Chainalysis, an analytics firm.",
                    "\"Hong Kong is desperate to rebuild and catch up with Singapore,\" Alex Au, co-founder of the city's Digital Asset Society, an industry group, told Nikkei Asia. \"In particular, Hong Kong wants to establish itself as an innovation hub. They see Web3 is an area of high growth.\"",
                    "Several leading tech companies and digital-asset startups are considering moving their headquarters or expanding in Hong Kong, Chan, the financial minister, said in January. Lawyers who help companies apply for a virtual asset service provider license, required for all crypto platforms by June, have said they have seen an uptick in inquiries from overseas companies.",
                    "Among the interested parties is Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange that was put under Sun's control this year, according to a blog post by its owners. Sun, who is also the founder of blockchain network TRON, said Huobi expected to increase its Hong Kong headcount from 50 to 200 by the end of the year, and expressed confidence that it would obtain a license from regulators that would enable it to switch its Asia headquarters from Singapore to the Chinese territory.",
                    "\"Singapore tightening their regulation is a bit too much of an overreach,\" Sun said. \"I believe that institutional money in Hong Kong has a significant advantage over Singapore. A lot of investment money, whether it's from overseas or from mainland China, is essentially all here in Hong Kong.\""

                    "A four-day workweek UK trial had promising results: less stress, better sleep, and no revenue loss.",
                    "Science explains why the four-day workweek could be good for employees and employers alike.",
                    "The UK trial is limited, but a shorter workweek could improve employee wellbeing and productivity.",
                    "The four-day workweek is more enticing than ever after a 61-company trial in the UK found almost no downsides and a heap of benefits.",
                    "The nonprofit 4 Day Week Global organized the pilot program and published promising results on Tuesday: The 2,900 workers in the trial reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, burnout, fatigue, and sleep issues, alongside better work-life balance. For the 47 companies that reported financial data, revenue largely stayed the same.",
                    "That all makes sense to Philip Gehrman, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania.",
                    "\"As much as work can be rewarding and fulfilling, it's also stressful and takes time that we'd like to spend doing other things. So it just seems logical to me that working fewer hours would be associated with a range of improvements,\" Gehrman told Insider.",
                    "The UK trial was limited, so take the results with a few grains of salt. There's no control group \u2014 a company or companies that maintained a five-day workweek, to compare against the four-day workweek companies.",
                    "There's also a risk of \"selection bias\" \u2014 a particular type of company may be far more likely to volunteer for a four-day workweek trial. Maybe they're especially receptive to their employees' wellbeing, for example, or they like to experiment and take risks. That could skew the results, meaning they don't represent most employers or workplaces.",
                    "The participating companies also weren't required to use the same schedule. Employers could nix Fridays, allow staff to work shorter hours over a five-day workweek, implement an average 32-hour week over the course of a year, or make the four-day week contingent on meeting performance targets.",
                    "Story continues",
                    "All in all, the trial lasted six months. Gehrman said he would like to see a longer study to know whether the positive effects last.",
                    "Still, other research on human brains and behavior supports the idea that less time on the job could be better for workers and their employers. Here's what science has to say about the UK four-day workweek trial results.",
                    "Our brains like deadlines",
                    "Many companies in the UK trial cut Friday out of the workweek. Arif Qazi/Insider",
                    "Having a shorter workweek could add a little extra pressure to work efficiently. That's because human brains sometimes work best on deadlines, according to Alex Korb, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
                    "\"It helps us focus our energy and our efforts,\" he told Insider. \"If I said you had some big project that was really difficult to do, and I didn't give you a deadline, well then it would probably take a really long time, and you might not make much progress at all.\"",
                    "Research has shown that people tend to increase their effort as a deadline approaches.",
                    "\"People are not robots. Most of the time, we're not working at our peak,\" Korb said. \"It's probably not even possible for people to work at their peak for eight hours a day, five days a week.\"",
                    "So shortening the workweek would cut some of that non-peak time, he said.",
                    "Fewer workdays can reduce (or compress) stress and improve focus",
                    "To state the obvious: Work can be stressful. Just waking up in the morning knowing you're about to work can cause your body to release higher levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, than it would on the weekend, two studies have found.",
                    "That's not necessarily bad. But prolonged stress, and too much cortisol over time, can contribute to a range of physical and mental health issues.",
                    "\"If suddenly you had an extra weekday \u2014 well, instead of five days of elevated cortisol, you only have four days of elevated cortisol,\" Korb said. \"That could certainly explain why people experience reduced burnout and improved mood.\"",
                    "Stress can also activate the body's fight-or-flight response and disrupt focus, leading to poorer job performance. Fewer stressful days could lead to more focused, effective workers.",
                    "Indeed, the UK trial reported small decreases in stress: on a scale of one to five, participating workers reported average stress levels of 3.07 before the trial, and 2.74 after the trial.",
                    "The four-day workweek could backfire in some cases, though: People who are expected to complete the same workload in less time could end up more stressed. That's what happened to 13% of workers in the UK trial, while 39% reported feeling less stress.",
                    "Sleeping well makes everything better",
                    "Americans have a sleeping problem. Over a third of US adults don't get the recommended seven hours or more each night, according to a 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
                    "With fewer hours of work, though, people would have more time to sleep. Cortisol, too, can affect sleep quality, so having fewer high-cortisol days (ahem, work days) may mean fewer days of meager sleep.",
                    "\"One of the first things that goes out the window when people are stressed is their sleep,\" said Gehrman, who directs U Penn's sleep neurobiology and psychopathology lab.",
                    "\"When people don't get enough sleep during the week, and they sleep in on the weekends, that two days of sleeping in is not enough to eliminate the effects of five days of inadequate sleep,\" he added. \"But three nights of recovery for four nights of sleep loss is definitely better.\"",
                    "In the 4-day work week pilot, 46% of employees reported less fatigue than usual. In turn, that could allow them to focus better on the job.",
                    "A shorter workweek probably wouldn't completely resolve America's sleeping woes, though.",
                    "\"I think it could be a piece of the puzzle,\" Gehrman said. \"It may not change the overall cultural attitudes towards the importance of sleep.\"",
                    "More time for chores, hobbies, family, and friends can benefit everyone",
                    "Workers in the UK trial reported having more time for housework, cooking, caring for others, social obligations, and hobbies. An abundance of research shows all of that is good for both mental and physical health.",
                    "A shorter workweek might mean fewer sick days",
                    "The UK report observed a decrease in absenteeism \u2014 the number of sick days or personal days employees took \u2014 but concluded that the drop was not statistically significant.",
                    "It is possible, however, that a shorter workweek could result in fewer sick days in the long run. That's partially because of basic statistics: There's a lower probability of illness falling on a workday when fewer of your days are workdays.",
                    "But there is also a strong link between cortisol, sleep, and the immune system. Over time, too much cortisol can impair the immune system, while sleep can restore it.",
                    "It could also help retain employees",
                    "The UK companies also reported fewer employees quitting their jobs during the trial period. Korb said there could be a simple reason for that.",
                    "\"Employees see the inherent value in having a four-day workweek, and if suddenly it feels like the company is actually interested in my wellbeing ... well, then it makes me more motivated to want to work for the company,\" he said.",

The Kyoto-based manufacturer has the capacity to produce 200 megawatt-hours per year -- the equivalent of 20,000 residential energy storage systems. Production is now running at around half capacity.",
                    "\"There is 40% less carbon dioxide produced in manufacturing,\" said Hidemichi Tonari of Kyocera's energy solutions business. \"The life is also longer than that of conventional batteries.\"",
                    "The battery's capacity is 140 watt-hours per kilogram -- only 60% or so of lithium-ion batteries. But semisolid batteries are competitive for what they offer in safety.",

                    "Battery development has coincided with the rise of electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries, with their liquid electrolytes, perform worse after repeated use. There is also the risk of fire if the battery fails to cool down properly.",

                    "In 2024, the European Union will require manufacturers to disclose greenhouse gas emissions from production and disposal. In 2027, the EU will restrict the market entry of batteries associated with high emissions.",
                    "In other words, demand will contract for high-capacity batteries with large carbon footprints. Japan and the U.S. are heading in the same direction.",

It can be recharged 9,000 times, triple the figure for typical lithium-ion batteries. Mass production of EnerCera coin batteries has begun in Yamanashi prefecture.",
                    "Luxembourg's Freyr Battery, which also licenses from 24M, is building a $1.7 billion factory in northern Norway. Trial production is set to start in March. Plans call for factories in the U.S. and Finland, with an eye toward ramping up output to 200 GWh annually by 2030.",
                    "Despite growing hopes for semisolid-state batteries, obstacles remain to their widespread adoption. The limited capacity of Kyocera's current product relative to conventional lithium-ion batteries is one example.",

                    "Kylian Mbappe has done little to dampen speculation over a blockbuster switch to Man Utd after publicly responding to a Red Devils star in the aftermath of the League Cup final.",
                    "The French megastar, 24, can stake a genuine claim to being the best footballer on the planet right now. Mbappe is operating at a goal-per-game this season (29 in 29) and has laid on seven assists for his teammates too. His exploits at the World Cup \u2013 in which he top-scored in the tournament and scored a hat-trick in the final \u2013 speak for themselves.",
                    "However, as recently as October transfer guru Fabrizio Romano reported Mbappe wanted out of PSG \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.",
                    "Mbappe signed a three-year deal back in May of 2022, though the third year is actually a player option. As such, Mbappe will technically be entering the final 12 months of his deal over the summer.",
                    "Man Utd\u2019s potential takeover \u2013 either by British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe or Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani \u2013 has sparked talk of a major transfer splash to kick a new era off in style.",
                    "Indeed, Football Insider recently reported Man Utd would undoubtedly be in the mix if Mbappe pushes to leave PSG and a new regime earmark several hundred million for a spectacular coup.",
                    "Of course, any such move is clearly in its infancy at present. However, Mbappe has done his part to keep the speculation alive by delivering a seven-word response to Jadon Sancho.",
                    "United ended their six-year trophy drought on Sunday when sinking Newcastle in the EFL Cup final. Sancho did not start the contest, though was a late introduction off the bench when replacing Antony.",
                    "The England international posted a picture of he and Marcus Rashford smiling while posing with the Carabao Cup on Instagram. Sancho\u2019s caption simply read: \u201cCarabao Cup winners!\u201d and tagged goalscorer Rashford.",
                    "Mbappe responded to the post with a seven-word reply, writing: \u201cGood to see you with the smile\u201d, followed by a praying emoji.",
                    "Sancho\u2019s United career looked in serious jeopardy around the turn of the year. The 22-year-old was understood to be suffering both physically and mentally and was overlooked for selection throughout the entire month of January.",
                    "However, Ten Hag had not given up on the player, instead placing the forward on an individual training programme over in the Netherlands during the World Cup break.",
                    "Ten Hag acted with caution, patience and understanding and chose to slowly reintegrate Sancho back into his plans when 2023 rolled around. He then received a rousing reception from the Old Trafford faithful upon returning in the EFL Cup against Nottingham Forest in February 1.",
                    "The Dutchman\u2019s handling of Sancho is yet another example of Ten Hag\u2019s masterful man-management. Three other huge calls he got spot on were recently detailed by Gary Neville.",
                    "Mbappe\u2019s simple response to Sancho echoes what many in the footballing world will be thinking, though will also do little to dampen the speculation over a blockbuster future move to Old Trafford.",

The microscope laid the technical foundation for the present in-orbit one.",
                    "Last November, the two-photon microscope used by the Shenzhou-15 astronauts was sent to China's space station onboard the Tianzhou-5 cargo craft.",
                    "It was installed by the crew recently before capturing three-dimensional structural images of skin epidermis and superficial dermis on their faces and forearms, said Wang Junjie, a team member from the College of Future Technology under Peking University.",
                    "The images showed clear three-dimensional structures of the skin layers, including the stratum corneum, the stratum granulosum, the stratum spinosum, the stratum basale, and the superficial dermis, indicating the success of the in-orbit verification experiments of the two-photon microscope, Wang added.",

                    "In the two-photon microscopic imaging, the signals can be observed through spontaneously fluorescent substances in cells and extracellular matrix, and play an important role in examining the metabolic stress response of mitochondria inside the astronauts' cells, thus monitoring their health conditions in orbit.",
                    "The first success of the in-orbit operation of the two-photon microscope reflects China's high level of high-end precision optical instrument manufacturing, said Cheng.",

                    "The Starlink V2 Mini satellites also carry an argon-fueled electrical propulsion system using Hall thrusters for on-orbit maneuvering. The new propulsion system has 2.4 times the thrust and 1.5 times the specific impulse, or fuel efficiency, of the krypton-fueled ion thrusters on the first generation of Starlink satellites.",
                    "The argon Hall thrusters were developed by SpaceX engineers, the company said, and are the first of their kind to operate in space. The electric propulsion system is highly efficient, but low thrust, generating an impulse by accelerating argon gas through the engine using electricity.",
                    "SpaceX says the argon thrusters can put out about 170 millinewtons, or about 0.04 pounds, of thrust. That\u2019s less than the weight of a AA battery. The entire thruster unit weighs less than 5 pounds, or 2.1 kilograms",
                    "Argon gas is cheaper than the krypton fuel used on the first generation of Starlink satellites. Before the Starlink network, most electric thrusters for in-space propulsion relied on more expensive xenon gas.",

The mitigations were installed on Starlink satellites after the first batch of spacecraft launched in 2019 were brighter than expected, raising concerns from scientists that thousands of the satellites could interfere with ground-based astronomy.",
                    "But the dark paint was not as effective as hoped, and SpaceX removed the visors from later Starlink satellites to allow them to use laser inter-satellite communications links. Ground teams also changed the orientation of the Starlink satellites to minimize reflections of sunlight that could reach the ground at twilight.",
                    "Later Starlink satellites used dielectric mirror film on spacecraft surfaces, which directs reflected sunlight away from Earth. The new generation of Starlink satellites include a combination of mirrors and a new type of low-reflectivity paint, and the solar arrays are designed to adjust their pointing when the spacecraft fly over regions of Earth at dawn and dusk.",

SpaceX said measurements, modeling, and analysis show the brightness mitigations will be effective in reducing the V2 Mini satellites\u2019 reflectivity, but engineers won\u2019t know for sure until scientists observe the satellites after launch.",
                    "\u201cWhat we learn from early observations will help us improve and refine mitigations,\u201d SpaceX said.",

                    "Like the previous series of Starlink satellites, the upgraded V2 Mini spacecraft use an \u201cautonomous collision avoidance system\u201d to help avoid impacts with other objects in orbit. Collisions in low Earth orbit could generate thousands of small fragments that would exacerbate the orbital debris problem.",

                    "Compared to pre-Holocene conditions (the last Glacial period), the Early Holocene (11,700-8,200 years ago) was a time of warm seas, a warm and dry Pacific Northwest, a warm and wet Southwest and fairly low fire activity.",
                    "By the Middle Holocene (8,200-4,200 years ago), that pattern reversed: The ocean's surface cooled, the Pacific Northwest became cool and wet, and the Southwest became drier.",
                    "The Late Holocene (4,200 years ago-present) is the most climatically variable period. It marks a period when the \"modern\" climate and temperature patterns are established. The study noted a defined interval of fire activity over the past two centuries that is linked to human activity.",

The Polystoechotes punctata or giant lacewing is the first of its kind recorded in eastern North America in over 50 years \u2014 and the first record of the species ever in the state.",
                    "The giant lacewing was formerly widespread across North America, but was mysteriously extirpated from eastern North America by the 1950s. This discovery suggests there may be relic populations of this large, Jurassic-Era insect yet to be discovered, explained Michael Skvarla, director of Penn State\u2019s Insect Identification Lab.",
                    "Skvarla found the specimen in 2012, but misidentified it and only discovered its true identity after teaching an online course based on his personal insect collection in 2020. He recently co-authored a paper about the discovery in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington.",
                    "\u201cI remember it vividly, because I was walking into Walmart to get milk and I saw this huge insect on the side of the building,\u201d said Skvarla, who was a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas at the time. \u201cI thought it looked interesting, so I put it in my hand and did the rest of my shopping with it between my fingers. I got home, mounted it, and promptly forgot about it for almost a decade.\u201d",
                    "It wasn\u2019t until the COVID-19 pandemic that the giant lacewing would find its time to shine. In the fall of 2020, with the world in lockdown, Skvarla was teaching Entomology 432: Insect Biodiversity and Evolution at Penn State. He taught the lab course via Zoom, with students following along remotely on loaner microscopes, and used his own personal insect collection as specimen samples.",
                    "As he went to demonstrate the features of a specimen he had previously labeled an \u201cantlion,\u201d Skvarla noticed that the characteristics didn\u2019t quite match those of the dragonfly-like predatory insect. Instead, he thought it looked more like a lacewing. A giant lacewing has a wingspan of roughly 50 millimeters, which is quite large for an insect, a clear indicator that the specimen was not an antlion, as Skvarla had mistakenly labeled it. The students got to work comparing features \u2014 and a discovery was made, live on Zoom.",
                    "\u201cWe were watching what Dr. Skvarla saw under his microscope and he\u2019s talking about the features and then just kinda stops,\u201d said Codey Mathis, a doctoral candidate in entomology at Penn State. \u201cWe all realized together that the insect was not what it was labeled and was in fact a super-rare giant lacewing. I still remember the feeling. It was so gratifying to know that the excitement doesn\u2019t dim, the wonder isn\u2019t lost. Here we were making a true discovery in the middle of an online lab course.\u201d",
                    "For additional confirmation, Skvarla and his colleagues performed molecular DNA analyses on the specimen. Since confirming its true identity, Skvarla has deposited the insect safely in the collections of the Frost Entomological Museum at Penn State, where scientists and students will have access to it for further research.",
                    "\u201cIt was one of those experiences you don\u2019t expect to have in a prerequisite lab course,\u201d Louis Nastasi, a doctoral candidate studying entomology at Penn State. \u201cHere we were, just looking at specimens to identify them and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this incredible new record pops up.\u201d",
                    "Discovery or recovery?",
                    "The fact that a giant lacewing was spotted in the urban area of Fayetteville, Arkansas may reveal a larger story about biodiversity and a changing environment, Skvarla explained. He said that explanations vary for the giant lacewing\u2019s disappearance from North America \u2014 and it still largely remains a mystery.",
                    "Scientists hypothesize the insect\u2019s disappearance could be due to the ever-increasing amount of artificial light and pollution of urbanization; suppression of forest fires in eastern North America, if the insects rely on post-fire environments; the introduction of non-native predators such as large ground beetles; and introduction of non-native earthworms, which significantly altered the composition of forest leaf litter and soil.",
                    "\u201cEntomology can function as a leading indicator for ecology,\u201d Skvarla said. \u201cThe fact that this insect was spotted in a region that it hasn\u2019t been seen in over half a century tells us something more broadly about the environment.\u201d",
                    "The researchers analyzed extensive collection records of giant lacewings, including museum holdings and community science submissions, and placed them into a single map to determine their distribution. The records span a huge geographic range, from Alaska to Panama, and include multiple ecoregions in both eastern and western North America. The map revealed the Arkansas specimen was the first spotted in eastern North America in over 50 years.",
                    "Fayetteville lies within the Ozark Mountains, which are a suspected biodiversity hotspot, according to Skvarla and his co-author J. Ray Fisher of the Mississippi Entomological Museum at Mississippi State University.",
                    "They said that dozens of endemic species, including 68 species of insects, are known from the Ozarks and at least 58 species of plants and animals have highly disjunct populations with representatives in the region. They explain that the area is understudied compared to regions of similar biodiversity, such as the Southern Appalachians.",
                    "\u201cThis combination makes the region an ideal place for a large, showy insect to hide undetected,\u201d they said.",
                    "The mystery remains as to how the insect arrived on the exterior of a Walmart. The fact that it was found on the side of a well-lit building at night suggests that it was likely attracted to the lights and may have flown at least a few hundred meters from where it originated, Skvarla explained. \u201cIt could have been 100 years since it was even in this area \u2014 and it\u2019s been years since it's been spotted anywhere near it. The next closest place that they've been found was 1,200 miles away, so very unlikely it would have traveled that far.\u201d",
                    "The researchers note that they suspect the new specimen represents a rare, surviving eastern population of giant lacewings that evaded detection and extinction.",
                    "\u201cDiscovery doesn't always hold that same kind of grasp on people that maybe it did 100 years ago,\u201d said Nastasi. \u201cBut a finding like this really highlights that even in a run-of-the-mill situation, there are still a tremendous number of discoveries to make about insects.\u201d"

However, these models predict low particle yields in the low transverse momentum region, which is at odds with experimental data. To address this discrepancy, researchers from Japan now propose a novel framework based on a \u201ccore-corona\u201d picture of QGP, which predicts that the corona component may contribute to the observed high particle yields.",
                    "Research in fundamental science has revealed the existence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) \u2013 a newly identified state of matter \u2013 as the constituent of the early universe. Known to have existed a microsecond after the Big Bang, the QGP, essentially a soup of quarks and gluons, cooled down with time to form hadrons like protons and neutrons \u2013 the building blocks of all matter. One way to reproduce the extreme conditions prevailing when QGP existed is through relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this regard, particle accelerator facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have furthered our understanding of QGP with experimental data pertaining to such collisions.",
                    "Meanwhile, theoretical physicists have employed multistage relativistic hydrodynamic models to explain the data, since the QGP behaves very much like a perfect fluid. However, there has been a serious lingering disagreement between these models and data in the region of low transverse momentum, where both the conventional and hybrid models have failed to explain the particle yields observed in the experiments.",
                    "Against this backdrop, a team of researchers from Japan, led by theoretical physicist Professor Tetsufumi Hirano of Sophia University, undertook an investigation to account for the missing particle yields in the relativistic hydrodynamic models. In their recent work, they proposed a novel \u201cdynamical core-corona initialization framework\u201d to comprehensively describe high-energy nuclear collisions. Their findings were published in the journal Physics Review C on November 18, 2022, and involved contributions from Dr. Yuuka Kanakubo, doctoral student at Sophia University, (Present affiliation: postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland) and Assistant Professor Yasuki Tachibana from Akita International University, Japan.",
                    "\u201cTo find a mechanism that can account for the discrepancy between theoretical modeling and experimental data, we used a dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI2) framework in which the particles generated during high-energy nuclear collisions are described using two components: the core, or equilibrated matter, and the corona, or nonequilibrated matter,\u201d explains Prof. Hirano. \u201cThis picture allows us to examine the contributions of the core and corona components towards hadron production in the low transverse momentum region.\u201d",
                    "Alongside, the researchers conducted heavy-ion Pb-Pb collision simulations on PYTHIA (a computer simulation program) at an energy of 2.76 TeV to test their DCCI2 framework. Dynamical initialization of the QGP fluids allowed the separation of core and corona components, which were made to undergo hadronization through \u201cswitching hypersurface\u201d and \u201cstring fragmentation,\u201d respectively. These hadrons were then subjected to resonance decays to obtain the transverse momentum (pT) spectra.",
                    "\u201cWe switched off the hadronic scatterings and performed only resonance decays to see a breakdown of the total yield into core and corona components, as hadronic scatterings mix up the two components in the late stage of reaction,\u201d explains Dr. Kanakubo.",
                    "The researchers then investigated the fraction of core and corona components in the pT spectra of charged pions, charged kaons, and protons and antiprotons for collisions at 2.76 TeV. Next, they compared these spectra with that obtained from experimental data (from the ALICE detector at LHC for Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV) to quantify the contributions from corona components. Lastly, they investigated the effects of contributions from corona components on the flow variables.",
                    "They found a relative increase in corona contributions in the spectral region of approximately 1 GeV for both 0-5% and 40-60% centrality classes. While this was true for all the hadrons, they found almost 50% corona contribution to particle production in the spectra of protons and antiprotons in the region of very low pT (\u2248 0 GeV) .",
                    "Furthermore, results from full DCCI2 simulations showed better agreement with the ALICE experimental data compared when only core components with hadronic scatterings (which neglect corona components) were compared. The corona contribution was found to be responsible for diluting the four-particle cumulants (a flow observable) obtained purely from core contributions, indicating more permutations of particles with corona contribution.",
                    "\u201cThese findings imply that the nonequilibrium corona components contribute to particle production in the region of very low transverse spectra,\u201d highlights Prof. Hirano. \u201cThis explains the missing yields in hydrodynamic models, which extract only the equilibrated core components from experimental data.

                    "TikTok users would be familiar with this device when the pandemic lockdown inspired many to seek out home workout equipment.",
                    "But if the combination of “walking” and “pad” has already lost you, here’s a quick catch-up: A walking pad is smaller and cheaper than a home treadmill, and is foldable and compact enough to slide under a desk, said See Siao Xu, a senior physiotherapist with Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Department of Physiotherapy. Some models even have removable handles and offer higher speeds for jogging, she said.",
                    "And, of course, you'll need to pair it with a standing desk. ",
                    "CAN YOU REALLY GET A WORKOUT OUT OF WALKING PADS?",
                    "If you’re aiming to simply increase your daily physical activity beyond walking to the bathroom or the nearby coffeeshop, a walking pad could help.",
                    "“Walking is a form of low-impact exercise that is suitable for most healthy adults and using the walking pad helps to increase their daily physical activity,” said Adjunct Professor Roger Tian, a senior consultant with Changi General Hospital’s Department of Sport & Exercise Medicine.",
                    "Shane Siou, a senior physiotherapist with Core Concepts, noted that a walking pad can be suitable for those who want to keep active but have difficulties heading outside “due to medical or physiological conditions”. “If your goal is to achieve a slow burn – that is, exercising at a low to moderate heart rate – using a walking pad as a workout modality may be quite convenient,” he said.",
                    "See added that the exercise benefits and intensity from using a walking pad and brisk walking in the park can be similar. “However, brisk walking outdoors would be a better option if you prefer fresh air and a change of scenery,” she said.",
                    "But for those looking for a more intense workout, Siou is convinced that they are less likely to use the walking pad. “Squeezing in a 20-minute circuit or HIIT (high-intensity, high impact) workout may serve their purpose more,” he said. “To be honest, I don’t think walking pads will be very popular in Singapore.”",
                    "What about weight loss? “While the consistent use of a walking pad may increase one’s caloric expenditure modestly, it may not be sufficient for meaningful weight loss,” said Adj Prof Tian. And it also doesn’t help if you’re munching on snacks or sipping bubble tea while walking. “Physical activity has to be combined with appropriate dietary management for the weight loss to be significant,” he said.",
                    "See explained: “To lose weight, the number of calories burnt should be more than the calorie intake. A daily deficit of 500 calories to 1,000 calories will help you lose 0.5kg to 1kg weekly”.",
                    "Walking 10,000 steps can burn approximately 300 calories to 500 calories but it only hits the lower end of the daily deficit range you need to lose weight. And that is why you need to adjust your calorie intake as well.",
                    "One thing’s for certain when using a walking pad: You’ll be in motion more than in a chair. “Moving regularly instead of maintaining prolonged static postures during work, such as sitting, is a good idea,” said See.",
                    "IT’S JUST WALKING. WHAT HARM CAN COME OF IT?",
                    "Going from sitting at your desk all day long to suddenly clocking 10,000 steps a day can cause overloading injuries, said See. “You may want to be mindful of taking breaks between your walks or increase the number of your steps progressively.”",
                    "Even for active individuals, said Siou, different muscle groups may be utilised when walking in shoes versus walking barefoot on the walking pad, which may lead to injuries. “Other potential trauma-related injuries such as ankle sprains may also happen if one is unfamiliar with the equipment or when one is distracted cognitively,” he said.",
                    "Speaking of footwear, can you forgo it when using the walking pad? Siou is of the opinion that “it wouldn't make any difference with or without shoes, unless you have underlying contraindications such as plantar fasciitis”. However, both Adj Prof Tian and See recommend proper shoes for protection and impact absorption. “Shoes also provide protection from friction and prevent the development of blisters,” said See.",
                    "Given the walking pad’s smaller walking surface and less stable nature compared to a treadmill, there could also be an increased risk of falls or injuries, said Adj Prof Tian.",

                    "Well, it is time to wake up to a new scientific finding: Sleeping too much is a problem too, at least where cancer risk is concerned.",
                    "In April 2022, Japanese scientists published their findings in the medical journal Cancer Epidemiology: Sleeping more than 10 hours a day (versus seven hours) increases the risk of dying from cancer by 18 per cent in men and 44 per cent in women.",
                    "This is a fairly sizeable study covering 5.9 million person-years (number of participants in the study multiplied by the number of years these participants have been followed up).",
                    "And in case you think that the finding in this study is an oddity in this area of medical research, it is not. This result is consistent with an earlier study in 2013 conducted in the United States among doctors. It concluded that sleeping more than nine hours a day (versus seven hours) is associated with a 35 per cent increase in colorectal cancer risk in men, particularly pronounced in those who are overweight or who had a snoring problem. An increase was seen in women too, though to a lesser degree.",
                    "Having said that, many of my patients who blamed their lack of adequate sleep in the past being a contributing factor to them developing cancer are also standing on firm scientific ground.",
                    "A European study in 2012 showed that sleeping less than six hours a day (versus seven to eight hours) is associated with a 43 per cent increase in risk of cancer.",
                    "If we accept the conclusions from the clinical studies above, what could be the scientific rationale for too much or too little sleep leading to cancer?",
                    "The mode of action likely relates to the disruption of normal circadian rhythm and/or poor quality of sleep.",
                    "Circadian rhythm describes the normal day-night and sleep-wake cycles of the body. A normal circadian rhythm is important in maintaining normal hormonal production and function of the immune system.",
                    "Abnormal hormone production has been implicated in pathways that drive, or fail to suppress, cancer cells formation. Impairment of normal immune function, on the other hand, has been implicated in how the body fails to eliminate potentially cancerous cells during their formative stages.",
                    "Disruption of the circadian rhythm may potentially affect people’s metabolism, making them more susceptible to carcinogens. Indeed, animal models have demonstrated greater cell damage and DNA replication errors in sleep-deprived laboratory animals. Cell damage and errors in the DNA codes of cells lead to genetic mutations, the basic mechanism that drives cancer cell transformation.",
                    "Sleeping excessively, on the other hand, has been associated with greater secretion, by the body, of inflammatory cytokines. Chronic inflammation is a possible pathway in the promotion of cancer growth.",
                    "Research focusing on the impact of disruption of normal sleep-wake circadian rhythm from a common phenomenon in any modern society, that of working night shifts, adds credence to the theory that messing with the normal circadian rhythm can have dire consequences.",
                    "Studies have shown that nurses and airline cabin crews who do shift work on a regular basis have an elevated breast cancer risk. Exposure to artificial light at night is thought to suppress the secretion of a hormone with a potential cancer-suppression effect, known as melatonin, by the pineal gland of the brain.",
                    "The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an organisation under the umbrella of the World Health Organisation, rates working night shifts as a probable carcinogen.",
                    "If exposure to artificial light at night is potentially harmful, it begs the question of whether the habit of some folks of sleeping with the lights on at night is unwittingly increasing their risk of cancer?",
                    "The research finding on this question is a mixed bag. A Spanish study in 2018 found that sleeping with the lights on at night is associated with an increase in the risk of prostate cancer, but paradoxically, associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.

Perin, MD, PhD, medical director at Texas Heart Institute.",
                    "In the intention-to-treat population of 565 patients, 28 of whom did not undergo a procedure due to protocol violations, the primary outcome of mean cumulative rate of recurrent nonfatal decompensated HF events per 100 patients did not differ between those assigned mesenchymal precursor cell therapy and those assigned the sham procedure at a mean follow-up of 29.9 months (HR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7; P = .406).

                    "DREAM-HF is the largest clinical trial of cell therapy in patients with HFrEF to date.",
                    "Healio spoke with Perin about the link between inflammation and HF, the importance of nuance in trial design for new therapies, and how cell therapy can work in parallel with guideline-directed medical therapy in HF. The findings were first reported by Healio when presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in 2021 and have now been published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.",
                    "Healio: What role does inflammation play in HF, and how does it drive adverse events?",
                    "Perin: Immunity and inflammation are at the core of dysfunction in HF. The main players in maintaining HF, cellularly speaking, are proinflammatory macrophages. This smoldering fire that goes on, especially in ischemic patients, is characteristic in HF. Everything else we see in HF \u2014 edema, shortness of breath, congestion \u2014 are all neurohormonal maladaptive changes in HF. That constellation of findings is secondary to what the body is trying to do.",
                    "Healio: Inflammation is at the core of HF, yet therapies targeting inflammation have not been successful. Why is that?",
                    "Perin: There have been several trials in this area that were not successful. That is likely because these trials have targeted single inflammatory markers. That is not enough.",
                    "The beauty of cell therapy is, if you put the cell in an inflammatory environment \u2014 and we believe where you put the cell is very important \u2014 these cells have receptors for things like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta and more. These mesenchymal precursor cells, or MPCs, get activated through these cytokines in that inflammatory environment and in turn respond by polarizing M1 macrophages, the main things that keep HF going, into M2s, the pro-healing phenotype. The cells secrete stromal cell-derived factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1, while the M2s secrete interleukin-10 and platelet-derived growth factor. All of these are all pro-healing and anti-inflammatory. So, we have an amplification. The living cells we put in read the environment, signal things to different cells and transform the environment. What I find absolutely fascinating is this is done at a distance. We see improvement at the level of the cardiomyocyte, but we also see this dramatic decrease in MI and stroke. How? This is an anti-atherosclerotic therapy, in addition to being a HF therapy. These cells are immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory.",
                    "Healio: This study missed its primary endpoints; however, there was a significant reduction in MI and stroke for people who received this therapy. Can you talk about the trial design for DREAM-HF? What were you and your colleagues looking for?",
                    "Perin: To frame this, I treated the very first patient with stem cell therapy in the world for the heart in Brazil in 2001. The first time an MPC was injected into a human for this therapy was 2007. Then we conducted a dose-finding trial, which gave us interesting signals. Now, we wanted to conduct a large phase 3 trial looking at clinical events.",
                    "There was one problem: We don\u2019t know what we are looking for. People have trouble understanding that. In cell therapy, we do not know what the endpoints are, making trial design very tricky. Yet, we hold these trials for unknown therapies to these standard, orthodox trial parameters.",
                    "For DREAM-HF, the primary endpoint was recurrent hospitalizations. That is not what cell therapy does. This is not a decongestive therapy. Cell therapy works locally, and at a distance. Locally, we see an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction across all patients that received the cells, which was statistically significant, and a dramatically significant reduction among the participants who had inflammation, defined as a C-reactive protein greater than 2 mg/L. We saw an amplified positive response in people with inflammation.",
                    "Then, we looked at a triple endpoint that included CV death. We had to prove that CV death contributed independently to the separation in the curves, and it did. We know that CV death contributed, and that is an important message. We have a therapy that decreases apoptosis. But it is also important to put the cells in the environment that has inflammation to see a local and systemic response.",
                    "If you look at all these big trials for other HF drugs, the endpoints group recurrent hospitalizations and cardiac death. Recurrent hospitalization is something that has to do with maladaptive changes in HF. CV death has to do with what is going on in HF and the events. We need to start thinking about therapies that address the cause and maintenance of HF, and then separately, all the guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF. Everyone in DREAM-HF was receiving maximized GDMT. We saw an effect with MI and stroke that was unexpected; however, it all starts to make sense once you understand it. You realize that these cells are addressing a part of HF that was never addressed. These should be parallel efforts. Yes, we need to address the symptoms of HF, the decongestion, volume issues. But now we can address it at the molecular level also.",
                    "What is the take-home message from the DREAM-HF study for cardiologists?",
                    "Perin: As with any novel therapy, in cell therapy, there was a lot of hype in the beginning. We knew very little about it. Some patients responded, others did not. Then, you go back to the drawing board and have to figure out what is going on, how to apply it. We look at the administration, the dose, what cells to use, the timing of administration, which patients are ideal candidates. Do patients need repeat administrations of the therapy? Our to-do list is long.",
                    "The takeaway is we have turned the page on cell therapy. We are at a phase where, years later, with data, we are understanding what is happening. There are critics of this field. With this study, we have legitimized cell therapy in HF. I know this treatment works, I\u2019m just not sure how to make it work. We have taken a major step in understanding how cell therapy can work in the heart and in HF. Cell therapy will open the door to a new way of treating HF that is complementary to what we do right now.",
                    "Healio: You mention your to-do list is long. What are the next steps for you and your team?",
                    "Perin: We need to do a confirmatory trial. I promise this: We will not get the endpoints wrong this time. We now have a blueprint for that, and we will have more data coming from DREAM-HF. I know what we need to do to get there, and we will get there. We look forward to making cell therapy an important part of treating HF.",

                    "Huichao Liang is the head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital that receives and treats pregnant and lying-in women infected with COVID-19, responsible for managing an isolation ward, and also responsible for the treatment of pregnant and lying-in women infected with COVID-19, as well as the consultation of obstetrics and gynecology in this hospital and other hospitals.",
                    "Liang Huichao said: \"Under the escort of the neonatal specialist medical team, the fetus was delivered safely in the early morning of November 1. The newborn is just 37 weeks full, weighs 2.85 kg, and the child has received a perfect score of 10 on one-minute, five-minute and ten-minute scores, which is very good. It is reported that the baby's nucleic acid test is currently negative, and further evaluation and dynamic monitoring are needed. After giving birth, Ms. Chen's symptoms caused by COVID-19 infection will also be relieved to a certain extent.",
                    "The First Emergency Operation Performed for COVID-19 Patients in Guangdong",
                    "Moreover, Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital is also the first hospital to perform emergency operation for COVID-19 patients in Guangdong. On the morning of February 3, 2020, Huichao Liang received a consultation request from the second isolation area. It turned out that Wenwen (pseudonym), a patient infected with COVID-19, suddenly suffered from abdominal pain and lower body bleeding. After conducting a detailed examination of Wenwen, Huichao Liang confirmed that her ovarian cyst had ruptured and an emergency surgery to remove the ovarian cyst was required immediately.\" The patient was very depressed, collapsed, and kept crying.\" Huichao Liang recalled. Wenwen's mother was a critical COVID-19 patient and was being rescued in the ICU. Her father was in isolation in a hotel, and her husband was in Wuhan. Wenwen felt that the whole sky was about to collapse.",
                    "Taking advantage of the time gap before the operation, Huichao Liang chatted with Wenwen, analyzed her situation and told her that according to her current condition an operation must be done and there was no possibility of conservative treatment with drugs.",
                    "The risk of the surgery for Wenwen is equivalent to that of ICU intubation for a COVID-19 patient. Therefore, medical staff must first put on a full set of protective clothing and then wear surgical gowns, N95 masks plus surgical masks, and safety goggles, implementing three-level protection. As the breathing and field of vision are limited, the surgery had \"to be ended as soon as possible\" in order to minimize the impact on the patient. More than 3 hours later, the operation was successfully completed. The molecular pathological test after operation confirmed that the virus had invaded the ovarian tissue. This was Huichao Liang's first operation under level III protection. The operation was also the first emergency operation performed for COVID-19 patients in Guangdong Province, providing the guidelines for the formulation of the surgical procedure under level III protection.",
                    "Huichao Liang's personal phone number was announced to the whole hospital by Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. When receiving the epidemic emergency notice from the hospital, Huichao Liang was the first person in the hospital to cancel the vacation and return to the hospital to stand by. She said, \"I am worried that if there is a co-infection occurred on pregnant and lying-in women, the situation will be very serious.\" During the entire epidemic period, she was in charge of all emergency cases related to the obstetrics and gynecology department and was 24 hours online. Huichao Liang had to go to the isolation ward and ICU almost every day.",
                    "On February 18, Wenwen recovered and was discharged from the hospital.",

                    "A new Mastodon app called Mammoth has already gained 10,000 downloads in the first few days of its availability on the App Store. The app was built by a team that includes the developer of the Aviary app for Twitter, which was among those unceremoniously killed by Twitter earlier this year after new owner Elon Musk decided the wider app ecosystem no longer had a need for third-party Twitter clients.",
                    "That decision left longtime Twitter apps in the lurch but prompted several app developers to turn their attention to the open-source, decentralized social network Mastodon instead. Last month, for example, the maker of the popular Twitter client Tweetbot launched a new Mastodon app called Ivory, after Elon Musk\u2019s API changes wiped out the company\u2019s Twitter-focused predecessor with no warning.",
                    "Now Mammoth is entering the market to offer users yet another option.",
                    "Unlike Ivory, which is an attempt to build a business to replace the losses from Tweetbot\u2019s closure, Mammoth \u2014 for the time being, at least \u2014 is free without any in-app purchases. However, the company has said it eventually plans to offer a subscription version of Mammoth and its community, moth.social, but it hasn\u2019t yet settled on the details.",
                    "In the meantime, its near-term goal is to encourage Mastodon adoption, the company explained in a blog post.",
                    "\u201c\u2026we don\u2019t think our subscription will be a paywall or that free users will get a read-only version of the app or moth.social. Simply: we want to contribute to Mastodon having 10m active users, then 100m. It\u2019s early days still, and we don\u2019t want to do anything that slows down adoption,\u201d writes Mammoth co-founder Bart Decrem. \u201cTherefore, we likely will have a subscription, but it won\u2019t stop you from enjoying the app if you\u2019re not paying. We don\u2019t have all the details or the timing figured out yet.\u201d",
                    "At launch, the Mammoth app offers access to a broad set of baseline features, like the ability to browse and switch between Mastodon timelines; post content including text, images, GIFs, polls; use features like private messages, lists, and bookmarks; change the app icon and theme; turn on a dark mode; access multiple accounts; and even undo posts with a custom duration, similar to Twitter. There are plenty of gestures and customization options to make Mammoth feel personalized to you.",
                    "The app also has an extensive set of less common features, like thread creation tools, picture-in-picture for pinning posts to your screen, tools for viewing media in AR, tools for sentiment analysis, the ability to hide replies, translation tools while in compose, and more. As an iOS app, users can take advantage of things like Siri Shortcuts, Face ID and Touch ID, Share Extensions, and VoiceOver support. The app will soon come to macOS, too, the company notes.",
                    "What\u2019s potentially more interesting than all of Mammoth\u2019s bells and whistles is its approach to user onboarding.",
                    "Choosing a server has often been said to be one of the more difficult parts of getting set up on Mastodon. It adds a layer of complexity to the setup process when users expect to be able to just create a username and password like they\u2019re used to on other social networks. But joining a server is part of what it means to participate on Mastodon and the broader group of interconnected servers known as the Fediverse, so it can\u2019t be bypassed.",
                    "To make this process easier, Mammoth presents a simplified user interface that walks users through the account setup process, including their profile creation. It also tackles the problem of who to follow on Mastodon by presenting an interface for finding suggested users from across categories \u2014 something Twitter also did back in the day.",
                    "Mammoth launched just days ago, but its 10,000 installs indicate there continues to be consumer demand for Mastodon apps, despite the competitive landscape that includes Mastodon\u2019s official client and a number of third-party apps, including the newly launched Ivory from Tapbots.",
                    "While some consumer interest in Mastodon may have waned since Musk\u2019s Twitter takeover, interest in the wider Fediverse continues to grow.",
                    "Before Musk\u2019s Twitter deal closed, the Fediverse \u2014 which includes Mastodon and a range of other social apps \u2014 had north of 570,000 monthly users. Today, the network has around 2.57 million. Companies are beginning to take note, too. Tumblr\u2019s owner has talked of adopting the same protocol that powers Mastodon and Flickr has been considering the same. Blogging site Medium last month established its own foothold in the Fediverse with the launch of its own community.",
                    "Mammoth is bullish on the Fediverse\u2019s potential and that of a decentralized internet in general.",
                    "The company says it will be open sourcing its code in addition to operating its own instance, and ultimately aims to make Mastodon easier for the next 10 million users, then the next 100 million. It\u2019s an ambitious goal, given Twitter itself had just 237.8 million monetizable daily active users in the last quarter it reported as a public company, compared with Facebook\u2019s 2 billion daily active users as of its most recent earnings. Whether or not a group of decentralized apps can ever carve out a large enough niche amid the shadow of tech giants remains to be seen. But it\u2019s arguably a more promising development than web3, which has squandered consumer trust by enabling scammers and pyramid schemes to proliferate.",

                    "It may be a chatbot\u2019s distorted reflection of the words and intentions of the people using it, said Professor Terry Sejnowski, a neuroscientist, psychologist and computer scientist who helped lay the intellectual and technical groundwork for modern AI.",

As Microsoft announced plans for a new and updated Bing search engine, with AI at its core, the world\u2019s biggest search engine Google, has also started finding ways of incorporating AI into helping users with their search results.",
                    "While Microsoft started the ball rolling by integrating AI into its search engine, Google and several other tech companies have also joined the race. All these companies are finding ways they can make the most of AI on their platforms. Microsoft has already released a version on preview mode and many users have found the updates both revolutionizing and exhilarating. For some, the use of the chat function on the updated Bing search engine has been quite comical and also worrying to some extent.",
                    "Tech Wire Asia had a few conversations with the chat function on the new Bing and ended up with some weird results as well. For example, when asked about Champions League football, the AI was providing results from the previous seasons and was not up to date with the latest information.",
                    "What\u2019s also interesting is that when the AI was asked to tell a joke, it shared a story of how it gave a user the wrong information for a recipe and messed up their meal. When told that the story is not really funny, the AI seemed to be \u201cupset\u201d and ended the conversation. The image below shows the conversation.",
                    "There have been many reports of users going through similar scenarios as well. In some cases, the AI even made the user feel unsafe with its responses. Since then, Microsoft has taken note of these reports and has limited the number of queries a user can ask in the chat function. They claim that AI is still learning and needs time to adopt.",
                    "What\u2019s interesting is that the grass isn\u2019t any greener on the other platforms as well. Google\u2019s Bard \u2013 its version of an AI search engine, caused the company heavy losses after giving out wrong information. Several tech companies in China claim to be working on similar platforms as well but non have yet to showcase any working examples yet, with Baidu\u2019s Ernie Bot seemingly the only one confident of availability in March 2023.",

According to statistics, most users still prefer using Google for their search queries with Microsoft only making a small chunk of the numbers.",
                    "But with AI seemingly revolutionizing search engines, Google knows it will have to take on Microsoft despite dominating the numbers. For Microsoft though, it is all about convincing users to make the switch to Bing from Google Search.",
                    "Currently, users need to access the new Bing search engine on Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser. Getting users to use the Edge browser will ultimately be the first challenge Microsoft would need to solve. Statistics show that as of January 2023, Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser only has a market share of 14.15% in the US. Google\u2019s Chrome controls the browser market with 61% with Apple\u2019s Safari browser coming in second.",
                    "Globally, Chrome also controls about 64% of the browser market. Other browsers include Mozilla Firefox which has almost the same number of users as the Edge browser. Hence, Microsoft would first need to convince more users to use their Edge browser before going all out on Bing.",
                    "At the same time, the new Bing needs to offer something that Google or any other search platform can. Currently, that would be its chat function. But the other platforms would definitely be looking into adding that themselves as well.",
                    "This is where Microsoft needs to really get its focus. They\u2019ve already announced some voice capability updates for mobile apps and Skype users. Still, is it enough to convince users to move from Google Search to Bing?",
                    "At the end of the day, Microsoft needs to go back to the basics \u2013 which is what the purpose of the technology is. And that is to help a user solve a problem.",

That\u2019s because people are using search to do things it wasn\u2019t originally designed to do. It\u2019s great for finding a website, but for more complex questions or tasks too often it falls short.\u201d",
                    "Perhaps if the search engine was also designed to do what it was asked to do and not try to outsmart the user, it could be a win for everyone."

                    "However, the port selection is also where the line's SKUs start to diverge: while 1 of the type-C ports on the L14 and L15 Gen 4 (Intel) models will be Thunderbolt 4 thanks to their new 13th-gen processors, their AMD counterparts get no similar USB4 love out of the box, even with updated Ryzen 7xxxn silicon.",

This, then, is probably why it is also the more expensive option, starting at \u20ac775 (~US$817) whereas the new L15 does so at \u20ac755 (~US$796).

Woo Jin Young has refused to comment on the issue when questioned by media outlets, while Netflix has released an official statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed with the production team at MBC that there were no technical issues with the game equipment. We\u2019d also like to confirm Jung Hae Min did not request a rematch.\u201d",

Claims note that Jung Hae Min was winning the first round, but Woo Jin Young stopped the competition stating an issue with his equipment. After production staff checked the equipment and found no issue, the competition was restarted after lubrication was added and the difficulty level was altered.",
                    "The second also saw Jung Hae Min win, but audio issues forced staff to request a rematch. Despite stating that he had no more strength left, production staff proceeded to convince and coerce the contestant to another round with a shortened rope length, ultimately losing in the third round.",

I think Jung Hae Min is not associating with Physical: 100 at all after the show because of what happened on set.\u201d Though MBC, the network behind Physical: 100, has refuted the claims, \u201cWe can confirm it\u2019s not true the final game was done three times. The production team is discussing taking legal action against these baseless rumors.\u201d",

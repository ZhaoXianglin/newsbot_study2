                    "A devastating new outbreak of avian flu \u2013 which has already wiped out wild bird populations across the UK \u2013 is likely to hit Britain in the spring. That is the stark warning made last week by ornithologists who said the disease has now established itself across many parts of the country.",
                    "\u201cWild birds arriving in Britain in a couple of months are very likely to trigger new outbreaks of the disease,\u201d said Claire Smith, senior conservation officer for the RSPB. \u201cA few months ago, I was relatively optimistic about its likely impact this year but outbreaks have continued throughout winter and the outlook for 2023 now looks much grimmer.\u201d",
                    "The current bird flu epidemic is caused by the H5N1 strain of virus, which originated in intensive poultry farms in Asia and has since spread round the globe, with infected migrating birds playing a pivotal roll in its spread.",
                    "In Britain, the disease has had a growing impact on wild birds over the past two years with 65 species being infected. About 16,000 barnacle geese died on the Solway Firth last winter, for example, while more than a quarter of the UK\u2019s only roseate tern colony, off the Northumberland coast, died in the summer.",
                    "On the island of Foula, in Shetland, 1,500 great skuas perished, a number that represents 4% of the world population of these rare large gulls. Similarly, thousands of birds have been reported dead at the Bass Rock, the world\u2019s largest colony of northern gannets. Britain is home to 55% of the global northern gannet population.",
                    "Bird flu has also begun to kill hen harriers and white-tailed eagles. Both species are of conservation concern, added Smith. \u201cWe are seeing kestrels and owls becoming infected \u2013 probably because they are catching mice and voles that have picked up the virus from poultry farms. These rodents are not necessarily affected by the virus but they are carrying it.\u201d",
                    "The virus has also infected otters and foxes, it was reported last week, though Smith stressed that all but one of these cases had actually occurred in 2021 or 2022. \u201cThe main problem we face is that we do not know exactly how prevalent this strain of bird flu has become,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe need to do a great deal of proactive testing to find how much the virus has spread among our wild birds and the government is not doing that.\u201d",
                    "The spread of avian flu puts further pressure on Britain\u2019s wild birds, particularly seabirds. Many species breed only once every four or five years but are already suffering from the effects of the climate crisis, commercial development of coastal areas and large-scale fishing of sand eels, an important source of food. \u201cIt\u2019s an increasingly worrying situation,\u201d said Smith.",
                    "At present, it is thought H5N1 only rarely infects people and few cases have been recorded of it being passed from one human to another. However, scientists warn there is a possibility that bird flu viruses could change and gain the ability to spread easily between people. Monitoring for human infection is extremely important, they warn."

                    "After a pandemic that predominantly killed the elderly and vulnerable, one might expect fewer deaths than normal in the years after it. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case in the UK. Quite the reverse.",
                    "Deaths are currently more numerous than in pre-pandemic years. In 2022, the UK recorded more than 650,000 deaths, around nine per cent more than in 2019. In the week ending 13 January 2023, 17,381 people died, compared with a five-year pre-pandemic average of 14,544 for the same week. A similar pattern can be seen across Europe. In Australia and the US, excess deaths for 2022 are also about 15 per cent above the pre-pandemic average.",
                    "There is no shortage of speculative explanations for the rise in excess deaths. According to the Guardian\u2019s Owen Jones, the UK\u2019s excess deaths are due to wicked Tory cuts in the NHS. This fails to explain comparable excess deaths in other countries. What is more, the number of NHS doctors and nurses has increased by 14 per cent and 11 per cent respectively since 2019. The NHS budget is up from \u00a3156 billion (inflation adjusted) in 2019-20 to \u00a3180 billion in 2022-23. So it isn\u2019t as straightforward as Jones suggests. Extreme anti-vaxxers are pushing an equally simplistic view. They effectively claim that excess deaths equal vaccine deaths. If that were true, then why does Sweden, which has a high Covid vaccination rate, have so little excess mortality? And why haven\u2019t there been big death spikes in the heavily vaccinated 15-44 demographic? Vaccines have provided useful protection for those most at risk. They broke the link between infections and deaths in 2021. Even with the Omicron wave in 2022, the over-80s of South Korea and Singapore \u2013 extensively vaccinated with mRNA products \u2013 recorded proportionately fewer deaths than the over-80s of Hong Kong, who were often unvaccinated or vaccinated with inferior Chinese products.",
                    "The bulk of the evidence points to lockdowns as the main cause of excess mortality. After all, lockdowns disrupted healthcare in myriad ways from which it has yet to recover. During the pandemic, the National Health Service was transformed into the National Covid Service. Routine activity was cancelled. Patients avoided seeking out healthcare, despite their symptoms. Either they feared catching Covid in hospital, they didn\u2019t want to be a nuisance or they were frightened to leave the house thanks to the orders to \u2018stay at home\u2019. The GP system has also been upended by lockdowns. During the pandemic, it became difficult to secure a GP appointment and, at many practices, it remains so. Face-to-face appointments now comprise less than 70 per cent of all appointments, compared with 80 per cent before the pandemic. At the worst practices, less than 20 per cent of appointments are now in person. The risk of missed and delayed diagnoses ought to be self-evident. You cannot feel a suspicious lump or detect an irregular heartbeat over the phone, or if the patient gives up and doesn\u2019t bother booking an appointment at all.",
                    "As early as December 2020, it was estimated that 4.4million UK cancer screenings had been missed. In the US, diagnosis rates of six common cancers fell between 16 and 42 per cent during the early days of the pandemic. The delays don\u2019t end after diagnosis. In the UK, the proportion of cancer patients having to wait over two months for treatment is still growing. These delays impact prognosis and outcomes. Cardiac deaths are a major slice of the current excess-death figures. Given that every minute counts when tending to heart-attack victims, the ever-rising delays in emergency care since spring 2022 are likely proving fatal.",
                    "Every medical specialist suspects more deaths are occuring in their field than the official data are recording. For instance, cases of blood poisoning (bacteraemia), due to the bacterium Escherichia coli, are ostensibly down by around 10 per cent per year since 2019. But there\u2019s no reason why numbers should have fallen during lockdown. The obvious suspicion is that cases are continuing or are even rising, but they are passing undetected and untreated \u2013 hidden among the growing tally of people dying at home. Furthermore, lockdowns promoted unhealthy lifestyles. Many of us sat about, eating too much and drinking too much while being stressed by apocalyptic news. In 2021, Public Health England reported that the average Briton gained half a stone during lockdown. Alcohol-related deaths hit a high in 2021.",
                    "Staying inside and apart from others likely weakened people\u2019s natural immunity to other viruses. Normal life exposes us to mild infections, which then reboost our immunity. The \u2018immune debt\u2019 that resulted from disrupting this process best explains the recent spikes in Strep A infection, RSV and influenza \u2013 which are also now contributing to excess mortality. Despite the vast cost of lockdowns, in truth they achieved very little. The initial Covid wave was already reaching its peak when the UK entered its first lockdown in March 2020. Sweden, then on a similar trajectory, opted for milder restrictions. For most of 2020 and 2021, the Swedes were berated as reckless and condemned for having higher mortality rates than their Nordic neighbours. Two years later, the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics found that Sweden, along with Norway, had the lowest total excess mortality in Europe from the start of 2020 to mid-2022.",
                    "Ever since mid-2021, Sweden\u2019s excess mortality has tracked lower than in its neighbours, frequently dipping to zero. Also of note is that Sweden, with a large infection wave in 2020 and no excess deaths now, refutes the idea that excess deaths are the late-arriving consequence of Covid infections. If they were, Sweden would now be enduring more deaths than its Nordic neighbours, which experienced smaller waves of infection in 2020 and 2021. In July 2020, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, asked to be judged in a year, not on the pandemic\u2019s first few weeks. It has taken longer, but Tegnell has now been vindicated. Meanwhile, our own leaders abandoned long-prepared pandemic plans and adopted untried lockdowns, believing the fantasy that they would save lives. They will not be remembered so well. Their legacy is writ large in economic ruin and excess deaths."

                    "It will bring together researchers from six major academic institutions across the two health jurisdictions, as well as patients, clinicians and industry, to work together to significantly improve cancer survival rates in the less survivable cancers such as liver, brain and oesophageal cancers.",
                    "The initial grant of \u20ac1m will allow AllCaN to focus on research into oesophageal cancer to improve early detection and outcomes for patients with, or at risk of, developing the disease.",
                    "Ireland and the UK have the highest incident rate of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the world.",
                    "In the Republic of Ireland there is a five-year survival rate of 24%.",
                    "The rate is 19% in Northern Ireland.",

                    "\"Research works and over the last 50 years, we have seen huge progress delivered in overall survival. Today we have over 200,000 cancer survivors in the Republic of Ireland but unfortunately, less than 1% of them have survived an oesophageal Cancer diagnosis. Research is not a luxury, it is a necessity,\" she said.",

                    "Researchers say the identification of, and improved treatments for people with Oesophageal Cancer and Barrett's oesophagus (a significant risk factor for oesophageal cancer), could significantly control the progression of the disease and improve survival rates.",
                    "Breakthrough Cancer Research joins researchers from six institutions to launch the first All-Ireland Cancer Network (AllCaN)",

That one goal managed to be his 200th in the Premier League, a record-breaking 267th goal for Spurs and also his very first goal for Arsenal. Impressive stuff, you have to say.",

                    "1. Can\u2019t start anywhere else, can we? With the only goal of the game, Harry Kane became the first player to score 200 Premier League goals for a single club, only the third to reach that total in all, and in scoring his 267th goal in all for Spurs went past Jimmy Greaves\u2019 all-time record for the club.",
                    "It wasn\u2019t the cleanest or most precise of those 267 but it was enough to make sure Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg\u2019s industry and Rodri\u2019s sloppiness were rewarded and punished respectively. And it might just be one of the most important of his goals given what it means to the title race and top-four picture. Has he in fact scored all those 200 goals for a single club? Because this was a pretty big goal for Arsenal\u2026",
                    "2. This was a huge opportunity grasped by Spurs in a season where they haven\u2019t always been quick to do so. Playing last on the weekend can work both ways and here Spurs came into the game knowing five of the top half had already dropped points this weekend, including Newcastle, Chelsea and Liverpool.",
                    "Knowing victory would take them within a point of Newcastle and nine and 10 clear of Chelsea and Liverpool. It\u2019s not the sort of opportunity one necessarily expects Spurs to take, but take it they deservedly did. It\u2019s their first win of the season against any of the teams above them in the league, one that puts firmly back in the top-four picture at exactly the same point where they began last season\u2019s charge. And they don\u2019t have to play Arsenal or City again.",
                    "3. And of course the opposite is true for City, who have missed an opportunity to stamp their authority on this title race. A rare sign of weakness from Arsenal was a chance for City to remind everyone that they\u2019ve been here before, that this is what they do, and that it\u2019s all scary and thrilling and new and unknown for Arsenal.",
                    "Given that, there is perhaps no stadium Pep Guardiola would have wanted to go to less than the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where he and his team have a cartoonishly abysmal record. Seriously, imagine compiling one of the most expensive and brilliant football teams of all time under one of the great managers of the age and have Tottenham as your bogey team. Absurd areas.",
                    "And yet here we are. This was City\u2019s fifth visit to Spurs\u2019 new stadium and their fifth defeat. An xG of 9.79 across those five games for Pep\u2019s men has delivered an actual G of 0.00. City have missed two penalties at this ground. Kyle Walker\u2019s five defeats in Tottenham as a City player are the same number he suffered in his final three and a half years as a Tottenham player.",
                    "4. On the subject of xG and 0.00, that was Erling Haaland\u2019s figure on a miserable afternoon for the Norwegian, one spent almost entirely in Eric Dier\u2019s back pocket. It feels vaguely absurd to criticise a man who remains firmly on track to break all known single-season Premier League scoring records, but on the days when the goals and even the shots don\u2019t come he is a passenger. Or arguably worse than that, an actual negative.",
                    "Haaland on his bad days can still look oddly out of place in this City team. A brilliant battering ram in an intricate machine of delicate moving parts. And the lack of all-round play of the sort so conspicuously present in the man who scored against City today and whom they were so strongly linked 18 months ago means a second striker, Julian Alvarez, has to be deployed alongside Haaland leaving City shorter than they would like in midfield. Today was the most troubling example of the phenomenon yet; for just about the first time under Guardiola, City are starting to quite often look like an expensively assembled gaggle of brilliant footballers rather than an expensively assembled brilliant football team.",
                    "5. It doesn\u2019t help that Guardiola appears increasingly determined to treat every big Premier League game like a Champions League knockout tie with clever-clever selections and baffling tactics. One could almost believe he\u2019s actively trying to make life harder for himself and his team. Like he\u2019s so thoroughly completed Premier League football that he\u2019s now just doing side quests. Can we beat a Champions League team without a midfield? What if I put Kevin De Bruyne on the bench again for some reason? Can we win without Big Erl having a single shot on goal?",
                    "This was a bafflingly poor performance from City, who dominated possession without ever looking like doing anything much with it while simultaneously leaving themselves wildly open to Spurs\u2019 counter-attacks. If you wanted to come up with the precise way not to play against this Spurs team, it would look very much like what City did today. Baffling.",
                    "6. But City\u2019s quality is such that it could still have worked without Spurs playing really bloody well. This was comfortably their best performance of the season, one of the very best of the Antonio Conte era \u2013 albeit without the manager present \u2013 and one in which players all over the pitch stood up.",
                    "Emerson Royal and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg had surely their best games for the club, all three centre-backs were magnificent while the sight of Manchester City continues to do things to Son Heung-min who looked far more like last season\u2019s iteration than has generally been the case for a while now.",
                    "7. Credit must go to Spurs, and criticism to City, for how comfortable it all felt. Clearly City were never out of it at 1-0 with the quality they possess, but at no point did it ever really feel like an equaliser was definitely around the corner. Given that barely a fortnight ago this City team had roared back from 2-0 down to blow this Spurs team away, it really was strikingly strange to see things all look so serene and straightforward for Spurs.",
                    "8. We find ourselves wondering whether Conte\u2019s absence from the touchline after gallbladder surgery might actually have helped Spurs here. This was not an afternoon for histrionics, but one for calm focus. And Conte\u2019s trusted assistant Christian Stellini is certainly a calmer touchline presence. #StelliniCam is not going to do as well on the socials, but it might be just what Spurs needed in this specific environment as they did their absent boss proud by delivering a Conteball Masterclass in his absence, restricting City to low-quality chances and desperate handball appeals while always looking like a dangerous side capable of adding more goals to the scoreline, at least until Romero\u2019s red.",
                    "9. Spurs have finally moved to address the conspicuous problem they have at right wing-back with the signing of Pedro Porro from Sporting, but he was never likely to figure today even had Conte been around to actually watch him train. This was a day that always called more for Emerson\u2019s defensive chops and he was magnificent. His running battle with Jack Grealish, City\u2019s most threatening but also frustrating attacker on a weird afternoon.",
                    "Emerson didn\u2019t win every battle with Grealish \u2013 it would be unreasonable to expect anyone to do so \u2013 but he stuck with the England man throughout and also got inside his head.",
                    "Grealish was the most fouled player on the pitch \u2013 not unusually \u2013 with seven, but also committed a match-leading five fouls himself. That surely must be more unusual. Emerson himself was fouled five times. It was a fun battle.",
                    "10. If Emerson emerging triumphant from his persona battle with Grealish was surprising, that was nothing compared to the shock of how thoroughly Hojbjerg bested Rodri in the middle of the park. The tone was set in the way Hojbjerg anticipated and pounced on Rodri\u2019s mistake to superbly set up Kane\u2019s match-winning, record-breaking goal but that was merely the most conspicuous example of a running theme through the afternoon.",
                    "Hojbjerg can be immensely irritating on his bad days, on those occasions when ostentatious gesturing replaces any actual football activity. But at his best for Spurs he can become a sensational all-action midfielder. This was one such afternoon.",
                    "11. If Kane took the headlines while Hojbjerg and Royal put in man-of-the-match candidate performances, the most interesting body of work perhaps came from Cristian Romero. Can the man of the match award go to a player whose been sent off? There was a genuine case to be made for it today.",
                    "Romero\u2019s two bookings were very different, but both in their way understandable. The one that brought his dismissal late on came as Grealish danced round him. It\u2019s the sort of booking any defender is at near constant risk of picking up against a team like City.",
                    "Which makes Romero\u2019s first booking even more interesting. It was on the face of it an extremely silly booking to collect, dished out inevitably for a reducer on Haaland inside City\u2019s half. It\u2019s not the first time Romero has picked up precisely that sort of booking and he sometimes almost seems to need to get himself booked just to get him in the game. Like Guardiola\u2019s team selection, it\u2019s like he\u2019s determined to play on a harder difficulty setting than necessary.",
                    "But was that daft first booking actually a selfless and crucial part of how the game panned out? It left Romero on a tightrope from which he ultimately stumbled, but it also left Haaland markedly less keen to get involved with the physical side of the game.",
                    "It might be giving Romero too much credit given the frequency with which he collects these sorts of bookings for fouls on lesser players than Haaland. It probably is exactly what it looks like: a brilliant but relentlessly aggressive defender who just loves to get involved. But intended or otherwise, the consequence of his action was a reduced and cowed Haaland for the rest of the game.",
                    "12. One thing that is absolutely certain about Romero\u2019s red card, though, is this. He was sent off with seven minutes remaining of a game Spurs were already winning. We must all be absolutely vigilant to stop this being described as a win for \u201c10-man Tottenham\u201d. We\u2019ve seen it several times already. You know who you are. You know what you\u2019re doing.",
                    "We\u2019re not certain exactly what the criteria should be before something can be described as a \u201c10-man win\u201d but we know it when we don\u2019t see it. This was not that.",
                    "13. Rico Lewis has been a breakout star for Manchester City this season at right-back and there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that Guardiola is willing to back him. Asking him to fill in here at left-back was a new challenge, though, and on a day that was generally challenging for a City side whose star players simply didn\u2019t turn up, Lewis was a bright spot. Dejan Kulusevski had a quiet game, while Emerson Royal\u2019s near laser focus on Grealish might also have made Lewis\u2019 life that little bit easier.",
                    "But he\u2019s come to a ground where City have struggled in the past and struggled again, and playing only his ninth Premier League game in an unfamiliar position, his performance was a rare bright spot.",
                    "14. Let\u2019s finish up with some observations about the record-breaker. The trophy thing will be wheeled out now, of course, and it\u2019s certainly valid to do so even if it isn\u2019t always done entirely in good faith.",
                    "But it\u2019s also true that, as Paul Robinson managed to rather clumsily attempt to say in an unfortunately worded tweet, that Kane doing what he\u2019s done for a team that doesn\u2019t sweep all before it is in its way more not less admirable.",
                    "15. And nor is his 200 goals a mere achievement of longevity. While Haaland may yet obliterate every mark Kane can set him if the lure of Barcelona doesn\u2019t become too strong, Kane has got to his 200 faster than Alan Shearer and way faster than Wayne Rooney.",
                    "His record of a goal every 127 minutes is the third best among all players with a deliberately Haaland-excluding minimum of 30 Premier League goals, behind only Thierry Henry (122) and Sergio Aguero (107).",
                    "16. He might not have any trophies, but it\u2019s still not bad for a one-season wonder."

                    "Until Erik ten Hag set foot inside Old Trafford last summer, the only throats Manchester United\u2019s players were likely to grab would have been each other\u2019s.",
                    "There is little doubt Ten Hag walked into a toxic dressing room. Stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba had been calling their own shots, some players were seething over their lack of playing time, and others were plotting their departures. It was the polar opposite of what the new manager would have wanted, and Ten Hag set about putting it right.",
                    "Arguably his greatest success so far has been to transform a bunch of self-centred and rather disillusioned individuals into a cohesive squad ready to fight for their club and each other.",
                    "Getting rid of a few bad apples and sticking to what has been described as a \u2018no d***heads\u2019 policy when signing new players has helped. But it still requires a strong manager and Ten Hag has certainly been that. A strict ethos has been put in place and this is now a group that mirrors the man in charge.",
                    "In an interview with The Times on Saturday, United midfielder Fred revealed one of three rules Ten Hag has written on the dressing-room wall: \u2018Always do what you can to help your partner.\u2019",
                    "Just a few hours later, his players followed it to the letter as they piled in to back up Antony after he was barged off the pitch at Old Trafford by Crystal Palace\u2019s Jeffrey Schlupp. Casemiro and Fred led the support for their Brazilian compatriot, but every player dived into the ruck with the exception of goalkeeper David de Gea.",
                    "No manager can be seen to condone a 20-man melee like that. But while Casemiro\u2019s red card and three-match ban for grabbing Will Hughes by the throat has presented Ten Hag with a problem, he was pleased to see his players fighting for each other.",
                    "\u2018Yes, we had some warnings about our team reacting like this, but you have to do it,\u2019 he said. \u2018You have to protect each other. We can\u2019t cross lines but we have to stick together and stand up for each other.\u2019",
                    "It threatened to derail what seemed like a routine win for United after they had taken a two-goal lead through an early penalty from Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford\u2019s 11th goal in 13 games.",
                    "Schlupp pulled one back but Ten Hag\u2019s side continued to stand strong, with Lisandro Martinez a colossus in defence, as they closed out a 13th straight home win in all competitions. The mood around Old Trafford at the end felt gladiatorial.",
                    "De Gea said: \u2018We fight and it feels great to have won the game like we did. I\u2019ve been in very tough moments for this club, now I\u2019m enjoying it more. The spirit is great, the atmosphere is great.\u2019",
                    "United will need all that fight in their two games this week, home and away against old rivals Leeds, and even more so because Casemiro will be missing.",
                    "Ten Hag felt with some justification that Jordan Ayew should also have seen red for trying to throttle Fred at the same time Casemiro had hold of Hughes.",
                    "The sense of injustice was exacerbated by the fact that Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta got away with an elbow on Martinez when the two clubs met at Selhurst Park last month, and VAR also decided not to intervene when Andy Carroll\u2019s challenge put Christian Eriksen out of action until early May during United\u2019s FA Cup win over Reading.",
                    "But Casemiro\u2019s fate was sealed from the moment referee Andre Marriner was advised to view the pitchside monitor, and his absence will be keenly felt. Since making his full debut against Real Sociedad in September, the 30-year-old has only been missing from the starting line-up in the Premier League on two occasions and those games ended with United losing 6-3 at Manchester City and 3-2 at Arsenal. This is good news for Leeds.",
                    "With Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Donny van de Beek also sidelined, Ten Hag must decide who to play alongside Fred.",
                    "Marcel Sabitzer, the loan signing from Bayern Munich, seems favourite after making his debut off the bench against Palace.",
                    "Prior to that, however, Sabitzer had only played one minute of competitive football since November due to Austria missing the World Cup and the extended winter break in Germany.",
                    "Martinez played in midfield for Ten Hag at Ajax and is another option, but the manager may be reluctant to break up his central defensive partnership with Raphael Varane.",
                    "It is not ideal. Whatever team Ten Hag sends out, though, at least he knows they will be up for the fight.",

                    "It felt like a glimpse of the future. Anthony Gordon may have only been on the field for 21 minutes, but the substitute made quite an impression on his Newcastle United debut in the 1-1 draw against West Ham on Saturday night.",
                    "It said it all that even the mere sight of Gordon receiving his final instructions from Eddie Howe on the touchline at St James' Park gave the crowd a lift before the forward received a huge cheer and had his name sung by the Gallowgate End when he replaced Allan Saint-Maximin in the second half. It was just what Newcastle needed and the last thing West Ham wanted at a time when the Hammers were pinned back in their own half.",
                    "To paraphrase the words Declan Rice uttered to Gordon, when the pair crossed paths in the interview area after the game, it was like the rapid youngster had a jetpack on his back when he entered the field. At a time when Newcastle needed to up the pace, Gordon demanded the ball and got his side moving.",
                    "Newcastle work a lot on pass and move combinations on the training pitch and Gordon's first touch was a tone-setting one-two with Joelinton before the new arrival picked out Sean Longstaff in space in the final third. Gordon continued to play one-twos - linking up with Joelinton and Joe Willock at various points - and that will be a feature of his game going forward as the new signing's team-mates look to release him and make the most of his pace.",
                    "Gordon also tried to be a creator, himself, and the best moment of his cameo came in the 75th minute when Miguel Almiron picked out his team-mate in the centre circle. Gordon was so far away from goal that West Ham were not panicking, but the forward took a touch to take the ball away from Ben Johnson before cutting West Ham's defence open with a superb through ball to send Callum Wilson racing clear. It looked like Wilson was about to put Newcastle back in front, with his second goal of the night, but Nayef Aguerd made a superb recovery tackle just as the striker was about to pull the trigger.",
                    "To think Gordon only had two touches in the opposition box, including a blocked shot, yet the youngster looked Newcastle's most dangerous outlet in the closing stages and even won a free-kick in the 88nd minute, which Wilson had a great chance to score from. Howe wanted a replacement for Chris Wood who was 'ready to play' and he has certainly got it in the \u00a340m man on this evidence.",
                    "The advantage of a signing like Gordon, of course, is he already knows the rigours of the league so the pace and physicality of English football won't have come as a surprise. However, in saying that, you have to go back to Boxing Day for his last start, for Everton, and it is easy to forget Gordon is a young player who will need an adjustment period on and off the pitch after moving away from home for the first time properly.",
                    "Also, it is not an exaggeration to say that Gordon will not only need to adapt to the intensity of training under Howe but the amount of information he has to take on to start a game, too, after only having one proper session with the full squad last Friday. It begs the question: does Gordon simply need more time before he could be in contention to make his full Newcastle debut?",
                    "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily a limit on him, but he will benefit so much from training with us,\" Howe told reporters after the game. \"The training he has had this week has been more individual based than team based.",
                    "\"That makes it very difficult to even build relationships within the team. He will have benefited from his little cameo, which was really positive, and next week he will train fully with the team as we prepare for Bournemouth.\"",

                    "And as he sifts through the wreckage of another dismal performance from his players, the Reds boss will no doubt have been mindful of two of his previous quips.",
                    "\"We really want to be the ugliest team to play against,\" he said back during the opening weeks of the 2018/19 season. \"None of the results we have this season would have been possible without the greed you have seen or without the aggression you see. No chance.\"",
                    "Then, of course, there was what Klopp said when he was unveiled as Reds boss back in 2015.",
                    "\"The first thing, always, maybe in life, you need to have a stable defence,\" he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible, can we be the hardest team to beat in the world? Let\u2019s try to be this.\"",
                    "Liverpool at present are far removed from being either. Instead of the hardest team to face in the Premier League, let alone the world, the Reds are currently one of the easiest. And, for their suffering supporters at least, they have become extremely ugly to watch rather than play against.",
                    "Klopp, speaking on Friday, insists there is no problem with the attitude or body language of his squad during training. The concern now, though, is whether the message is being put across properly or, more worryingly, if the players even have belief in the methods and are paying full attention.",
                    "However, it could just be that those available are simply not capable enough. \"The opposite of what we wanted to do,\" said Klopp of the two goals in the opening 12 minutes that sent Wolverhampton Wanderers on their way to victory on Saturday, hinting that how Liverpool prepared wasn't followed. The occasional lapse is permitted, yes - the fault lines, though, travel deep into this increasingly tortuous campaign.",
                    "The resilience and intensity for which Liverpool became famed - 'mentality monsters', don't forget - have been sorely lacking, Alisson Becker suggesting the team is missing some of its bigger personalities. Indeed, despite the travails of earlier in the campaign, the Reds will surely be more steeled with the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino on which to call.",
                    "The lack of a leader in the heart of defence was noted by former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, who suggested centre-backs be judged when they have to lead themselves. Neither Joel Matip nor Joe Gomez, despite more than 14 years of experience combined at Anfield, demonstrated the qualities that are evident in the absent Van Dijk, Konate and, as was shown two seasons ago, the benched Nat Phillips.",
                    "And the troubles on the road are particularly untimely given the fixture list the Reds have been asked to negotiate since the World Cup. In 17 matches from the resumption of the season to the Champions League round of 16 second leg tie at Real Madrid, 11 will have been away. Having won just four of 10 on the road beforehand - and one of those was at a neutral venue in the Community Shield - it's therefore no surprise to see the Reds now floundering in mid-table.",
                    "Saturday's 3-0 reverse at Molineux sent Liverpool tumbling to a sixth defeat in 10 Premier League away games this season. For context, in the previous four campaigns they only lost nine such games in total - and two of those came after they had already sealed the championship in 2019/20.",
                    "A third successive away league defeat was their first such slump under Klopp and their worst run since they lost four in a row towards the end of the 2011/12 campaign. And not since December 1993 had Liverpool conceded three goals in three successive away games.",
                    "Even the statistics referring to Wolves alone make for grim reading. The Midlands side hadn't won at home in the league against Liverpool since 1981, and had failed to score more than once in such a fixture in more than 42 years. And having netted just six times in 10 Premier League home games before Saturday, they had increased that tally by 50% come full-time.",
                    "The only Premier League clean sheet Liverpool have kept on the road since the end of last April was a drab goalless Goodison derby draw against Everton in September. In the same period, Arsenal have kept seven such shut-outs, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur five each, Manchester City four and Manchester United three.",
                    "Small wonder Liverpool trail those teams in the table. Klopp knows the uncomfortable truth for his players is they have no option but to turn ugly once again - but for all the right reasons.",

                    "Researchers at University College London and the University of Cambridge have discovered a new type of ice that more closely resembles liquid water than any other known ices and that may rewrite our understanding of water and its many anomalies.",
                    "The newly discovered ice is amorphous \u2014 that is, its molecules are in a disorganized form, not neatly ordered as they are in ordinary, crystalline ice. Amorphous ice, although rare on Earth, is the main type of ice found in space. That is because, in the colder environment of space, ice does not have enough thermal energy to form crystals.",
                    "For the study, published in the journal Science, the research team used a process called ball milling, vigorously shaking ordinary ice together with steel balls in a jar cooled to -200 degrees Centigrade.",
                    "They found that, rather than ending up with small bits of ordinary ice, the process yielded a novel amorphous form of ice that, unlike all other known ices, had the same density as liquid water and whose state resembled water in solid form. They named the new ice medium-density amorphous ice (MDA).",
                    "The team suggested that MDA (which looks like a fine white powder) may exist inside ice moons of the outer solar system, as tidal forces from gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn may exert similar shear forces on ordinary ice as those created by ball milling. In addition, the team found that when MDA was warmed up and recrystallized, it released an extraordinary amount of heat, meaning it could trigger tectonic motions and \u201cicequakes\u201d in the kilometers-thick covering of ice on moons such as Jupiter\u2019s Ganymede (pictured below).",
                    "Senior author Professor Christoph Salzmann (UCL Chemistry) said: \u201cWater is the foundation of all life. Our existence depends on it, we launch space missions searching for it, yet from a scientific point of view it is poorly understood.",
                    "\u201cWe know of 20 crystalline forms of ice, but only two main types of amorphous ice have previously been discovered, known as high-density and low-density amorphous ices. There is a huge density gap between them and the accepted wisdom has been that no ice exists within that density gap. Our study shows that the density of MDA is precisely within this density gap and this finding may have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of liquid water and its many anomalies.\u201d",
                    "The density gap between the known amorphous ices has led scientists to suggest water in fact exists as two liquids at very cold temperatures and that theoretically, at a certain temperature, both of these liquids could co-exist, with one type floating above the other, as when mixing oil and water. This hypothesis has been demonstrated in a computer simulation, but not confirmed by experiment. The researchers say that their new study may raise questions about the validity of this idea.",
                    "Professor Salzmann said: \u201cExisting models of water should be re-tested. They need to be able to explain the existence of medium-density amorphous ice. This could be the starting point for finally explaining liquid water.\u201d",
                    "The researchers proposed that the newly discovered ice may be the true glassy state of liquid water \u2013 that is, a precise replica of liquid water in solid form, in the same way that glass in windows is the solid form of liquid silicon dioxide. However, another scenario is that MDA is not glassy at all, but is in a heavily sheared crystalline state.",
                    "Co-author Professor Andrea Sella (UCL Chemistry) said: \u201cWe have shown it is possible to create what looks like a stop-motion kind of water. This is an unexpected and quite amazing finding.\u201d",
                    "Lead author Dr. Alexander Rosu-Finsen, who carried out the experimental work while at UCL Chemistry, said: \u201cWe shook the ice like crazy for a long time and destroyed the crystal structure. Rather than ending up with smaller pieces of ice, we realized that we had come up with an entirely new kind of thing, with some remarkable properties.\u201d",
                    "By mimicking the ball-milling procedure via repeated random shearing of crystalline ice, the team also created a computational model of MDA. Dr Michael Davies, who carried out the computational modeling whilst a PhD student in the ICE (interfaces, catalytic & environmental) lab at UCL and the University of Cambridge, said: \u201cOur discovery of MDA raises many questions on the nature of liquid water and so understanding MDA\u2019s precise atomic structure is very important.\u201d",
                    "Water has many anomalies that have long baffled scientists. For instance, water is at its most dense at 4 degrees Centigrade and becomes less dense as it freezes (hence why ice floats). Also, the more you squeeze liquid water, the easier it gets to compress, deviating from principles true for most other substances.",
                    "Amorphous ice was first discovered in its low-density form in the 1930s when scientists condensed water vapor on a metal surface cooled to -110 degrees Centigrade. Its high-density state was discovered in the 1980s when ordinary ice was compressed at nearly -200 degrees Centigrade. While common in space, on Earth, amorphous ice is thought only to occur in the cold upper reaches of the atmosphere.",
                    "Ball milling is a technique used in several industries to grind or blend materials, but had not before been applied to ice. In the study, liquid nitrogen was used to cool a grinding jar to -200 degrees Centigrade and the density of the ball-milled ice was determined from its buoyancy in liquid nitrogen. The researchers used a number of other techniques to analyze the structure and properties of MDA, including X-ray diffraction (looking at the pattern of X-rays reflected off the ice) and Raman spectroscopy (looking at how the ice scatters light) at UCL Chemistry as well as small-angle diffraction at the UCL Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering to explore its long-range structure.",
                    "How to make medium-density amorphous ice (MDA). By repeatedly shearing hexagonal ice we can create MDA.",
                    "Furthermore, they used calorimetry to investigate the heat released when the medium-density ice recrystallized at warmer temperatures. They found that, if they compressed the MDA and then warmed it up, it released a surprisingly large amount of energy as it recrystallized showing that H 2 O can be a high-energy geophysical material that may drive tectonic motions in the ice moons of the solar system.",

                    "The hypermassive star was produced by the merger of two smaller neutron stars. Normally such collisions result in neutron stars so massive that they collapse into a black hole almost instantaneously under their own gravity. But the latest observations revealed the monster star hovering in view for more than a day before it faded out of sight.",
                    "\u201cSuch a massive neutron star with a long life expectancy is not normally thought to be possible,\u201d said Dr Nuria Jordana-Mitjans, an astronomer at the University of Bath. \u201cIt is a mystery why this one was so long-lived.\u201d",
                    "The observations also raise questions about the source of incredibly energetic flashes, known as short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), that accompany neutron star mergers. These outbursts \u2013 the most energetic events in the universe since the big bang \u2013 were widely assumed to be launched from the poles of the newly formed black hole. But in this case, the observed gamma-ray burst must have emanated from the neutron star itself, suggesting that an entirely different process was at play.",
                    "Neutron stars are the smallest, densest stars in existence, occupying a sweet spot between conventional stars and black holes. They are about 12 miles wide, and so dense that a teaspoon of material would have a mass of 1bn tonnes. They have a smooth crust of pure neutrons, 10bn times stronger than steel.",
                    "\u201cThey\u2019re such weird exotic objects,\u201d said Prof Carole Mundell, an astronomer at the University of Bath and co-author of the study. \u201cWe can\u2019t gather this material and bring it back to our lab so the only way we can study it is when they do something in the sky that we can observe.\u201d",
                    "In this case, Mundell said, something appears to have prevented the neutron star \u201cnoticing how massive it is\u201d. One possibility is that the star was spinning so fast and with such immense magnetic fields that its collapse was delayed \u2013 something like how water stays inside a tilted bucket if it is swung around fast enough.",
                    "\u201cThis is the first direct glimpse that we may have of a hypermassive spinning neutron star in nature,\u201d said Mundell. \u201cMy hunch is we\u2019ll be finding more of them.\u201d",
                    "The unexpected sightings were made using Nasa\u2019s orbiting Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which detected the initial gamma-ray burst coming from a galaxy about 10.6bn light years away. A robotic observatory, the Liverpool Telescope, situated in the Canary Islands, then automatically swivelled to view the aftermath of the merger. These observations revealed telltale signatures of a highly magnetised, rapidly spinning neutron star.",
                    "This suggests that the neutron star itself launched the gamma-ray burst, rather than it occurring after its gravitational collapse. Until now, the exact sequence of events has been hard to figure out.",

This is not time travel and won\u2019t lead to communicating with the past \u2013 but it is an intriguing demonstration of how time can be thought to work at a quantum level.",
                    "Unless you have a TARDIS or a DeLorean, time only flows in one direction (forward) for us. This annoying little fact that protects us from all sorts of paradoxes is called the arrow of time. It is believed to be related to the concept of entropy (which always increases in an isolated system like the universe) but it doesn\u2019t seem to be as fundamental at the quantum level.",
                    "Instead, something that appears to be fundamental is the so-called CPT symmetry (charge, parity, and time reversal symmetry). This holds for all physical phenomena, and if a combination of two of them is violated (such as famously the CP violations) there ought to be a violation in time symmetry as well.",
                    "This has some fun theoretical applications, for example where an electron moving forward in time can be thought of as a mirrored positron (the antimatter equivalent) going back in time. Mathematically, it works \u2013 but it\u2019s not like the little antimatter we see in the universe is doing a Back to the Future.",
                    "Recent research suggested that it was possible to have photons in a superposition of states backward and forward in time. Now, that idea has been demonstrated experimentally. Superposition is a quantum phenomenon where a particle is in multiple states at once. Only when it is measured does the particle settles into one of them.",
                    "In one of the experiments, a photon was placed on a superposition of processes as it moved through a crystal. Photons have no charge, so by changing parity (mirroring its motion in 3D) it is equivalent to the behavior of a photon moving back in time. The process called quantum time flip was demonstrated.",
                    "Again, the work doesn\u2019t allow us to change the past. However, it might have some interesting applications in quantum computers, especially when it comes to logical operations, the crucial architecture of computer processes. The ability to have quantum time flips could allow for better performances and switching inputs and outputs.",

Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity has been remarkably successful in describing the gravity of stars and planets, but it doesn\u2019t seem to apply perfectly on all scales.",
                    "General relativity has passed many years of observational tests, from Eddington\u2019s measurement of the deflection of starlight by the Sun in 1919 to the recent detection of gravitational waves. However, gaps in our understanding start to appear when we try to apply it to extremely small distances, where the laws of quantum mechanics operate, or when we try to describe the entire universe.",

We believe our approach may one day help resolve some of the biggest mysteries in cosmology, and the results hint that the theory of general relativity may need to be tweaked on this scale.",
                    "Faulty model?",
                    "Quantum theory predicts that empty space, the vacuum, is packed with energy. We do not notice its presence because our devices can only measure changes in energy rather than its total amount.",
                    "However, according to Einstein, the vacuum energy has a repulsive gravity \u2013 it pushes the empty space apart. Interestingly, in 1998, it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is in fact accelerating (a finding awarded with the 2011 Nobel prize in physics). However, the amount of vacuum energy, or dark energy as it has been called, necessary to explain the acceleration is many orders of magnitude smaller than what quantum theory predicts.",
                    "Hence the big question, dubbed \u201cthe old cosmological constant problem\u201d, is whether the vacuum energy actually gravitates \u2013 exerting a gravitational force and changing the expansion of the universe.",
                    "If yes, then why is its gravity so much weaker than predicted? If the vacuum does not gravitate at all, what is causing the cosmic acceleration?",
                    "We don\u2019t know what dark energy is, but we need to assume it exists in order to explain the universe\u2019s expansion. Similarly, we also need to assume there is a type of invisible matter presence, dubbed dark matter, to explain how galaxies and clusters evolved to be the way we observe them today.",
                    "These assumptions are baked into scientists\u2019 standard cosmological theory, called the lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) model \u2013 suggesting there is 70% dark energy, 25% dark matter and 5% ordinary matter in the cosmos. And this model has been remarkably successful in fitting all the data collected by cosmologists over the past 20 years.",
                    "But the fact that most of the universe is made up of dark forces and substances, taking odd values that don\u2019t make sense, has prompted many physicists to wonder if Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity needs modification to describe the entire universe.",
                    "A new twist appeared a few years ago when it became apparent that different ways of measuring the rate of cosmic expansion, dubbed the Hubble constant, give different answers \u2013 a problem known as the Hubble tension.",
                    "The disagreement, or tension, is between two values of the Hubble constant. One is the number predicted by the LCDM cosmological model, which has been developed to match the light left over from the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background radiation). The other is the expansion rate measured by observing exploding stars known as supernovas in distant galaxies.",
                    "Nasa",
                    "Many theoretical ideas have been proposed for ways of modifying LCDM to explain the Hubble tension. Among them are alternative gravity theories.",
                    "Digging for answers",
                    "We can design tests to check if the universe obeys the rules of Einstein\u2019s theory. General relativity describes gravity as the curving or warping of space and time, bending the pathways along which light and matter travel. Importantly, it predicts that the trajectories of light rays and matter should be bent by gravity in the same way.",
                    "Together with a team of cosmologists, we put the basic laws of general relativity to test. We also explored whether modifying Einstein\u2019s theory could help resolve some of the open problems of cosmology, such as the Hubble tension.",
                    "To find out whether general relativity is correct on large scales, we set out, for the first time, to simultaneously investigate three aspects of it. These were the expansion of the universe, the effects of gravity on light and the effects of gravity on matter.",
                    "Using a statistical method known as the Bayesian inference, we reconstructed the gravity of the universe through cosmic history in a computer model based on these three parameters. We could estimate the parameters using the cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, supernova catalogues as well as observations of the shapes and distribution of distant galaxies by the SDSS and DES telescopes. We then compared our reconstruction to the prediction of the LCDM model (essentially Einstein\u2019s model).",
                    "We found interesting hints of a possible mismatch with Einstein\u2019s prediction, albeit with rather low statistical significance. This means that there is nevertheless a possibility that gravity works differently on large scales, and that the theory of general relativity may need to be tweaked.",
                    "Our study also found that it is very difficult to solve the Hubble tension problem by only changing the theory of gravity. The full solution would probably require a new ingredient in the cosmological model, present before the time when protons and electrons first combined to form hydrogen just after the Big Bang, such as a special form of dark matter, an early type of dark energy or primordial magnetic fields. Or, perhaps, there\u2019s a yet unknown systematic error in the data.",
                    "That said, our study has demonstrated that it is possible to test the validity of general relativity over cosmological distances using observational data. While we haven\u2019t yet solved the Hubble problem, we will have a lot more data from new probes in a few years.",
                    "This means that we will be able to use these statistical methods to continue tweaking general relativity, exploring the limits of modifications, to pave the way to resolving some of the open challenges in cosmology."

                    "Temperature is one of those fundamental concepts that despite our everyday experience with it, we can easily be baffled by. And this is not just true for non-experts. Temperature has been a crucial scientific concept for centuries and understanding its limits impacts us far beyond pure science.",
                    "It all boils down (pardon the pun) to thermodynamics, the study of energy, temperature, heat, and work and how they relate to each other. The four laws (from zeroth to third) are so fundamental that they pop up in completely different disciplines. And people have dedicated their lives trying to disprove them, with no success.",
                    "The zeroth law affirms that temperature is an important empirical parameter and that thermal equilibrium is a transitive relation. So if object A and object B are in thermal equilibrium with object C, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. That is pretty much saying that thermometers are indeed an accurate way to measure things, and if one says yesterday was X degrees and then says that today is also X degrees, that means that both days had the same temperature.",
                    "One of our favorite analogies for the other three laws is to picture the universe as a gambling table. The first law is the conservation of energy and it is equivalent to knowing that you cannot win at this table because you can\u2019t create something out of nothing. The second law tells us that you can\u2019t even draw. No system is 100 percent efficient and entropy always increases in an isolated system. Sorry, perpetual motion machine fans, it can\u2019t be done.",
                    "The third one says that you can\u2019t leave the table. You can\u2019t choose not to play this game. You are subjected to the laws of thermodynamics wherever you go and those laws suggest that there is an ultimate lowest possible temperature: absolute zero.",
                    "What is absolute zero?",
                    "The temperature of an object or substance is due to the motion of its molecules. The hotter it is, the more the molecules shake. As energy is removed from a system through thermodynamical processes (like in a fridge for example), the molecules slow down.",
                    "And that\u2019s where absolute zero comes in. There is going to be a point when molecules are still, motionless. There is no way to slow them down further. No further lower temperature can be reached.",
                    "The value of absolute zero is \u2212273.15\u00b0C (\u2212459.67\u00b0F) or simply 0 Kelvin in the International System of Units scale. The record for the coldest temperature ever achieved was broken just over a year ago with the cooling of rubidium gas to 38 picokelvins (3.8 * 10-11 K), truly just a fraction above absolute zero.",
                    "What\u2019s the hottest temperature in the Universe?",
                    "Humans like symmetry, so if there is a lower limit, is there also an upper limit? Well, things are not so clear-cut when it comes to how hot something can be. The hottest temperature ever created in the lab was 5 trillion Kelvin. It was created in the Large Hadron Collider and it was the temperature of the Universe a few instants after the Big Bang.",
                    "But can we go hotter than that? It might be possible for sure. When it comes to the physics of the hottest, we are yet to find something as strict as absolute zero. Absolute hotness has several possibilities, it could be 10,000 times hotter than what we have achieved in particle colliders for example. But it is not strict.",
                    "The only limit that can be found in physics depends on the so-called Planck scale. This set of units of measurement depends exclusively on physical constants and tends to signal where physics as we know it breaks apart. Planck temperature is equivalent to 1.4 x 1032 K. That\u2019s 100 billion billion times what you can get in a particle accelerator. Scientists don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to get any hotter than that, but the true limit may be much lower."

                    "The first instrument to detect a gamma ray burst (GRB) was watching for the end of the world. What it ended up seeing was quite possibly the end of someone else\u2019s.",
                    "In the 1960s, during the height of the Cold War, the US military deployed a group of satellites called Vela to monitor the planet and our vicinity in outer space for the characteristic flash of high-energy radiation \u2013 gamma rays and X-rays \u2013 that would give away the location of secret nuclear weapon tests, even if they were being carried out behind the Moon.",
                    "The first events Vela observed, however, looked nothing like the kind of flash a nuclear bomb would produce, and seemed to be coming from deep space. For years afterward, there ensued a long debate about their nature and origin: where could these spectacular bursts of radiation be coming from? Some argued they were extraordinarily bright explosions outside our Galaxy. Others thought nothing could possibly be that bright \u2013 perhaps they were some kind of ultra-powerful solar flare from stars closer to us.",
                    "The debate about their distance was eventually won through a clever argument that had little to do with the bursts themselves. Observers had already noticed that the bursts were appearing all over the sky, with no extra concentration in any particular direction. Polish astronomer Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski pointed out that left only two options. One: they are very close by, in our immediate vicinity, presumably arising from very nearby stars, or two: they\u2019re so far away that they must be in very distant galaxies.",
                    "In both cases, they\u2019d appear everywhere, either because the clump of stars around us is too small a piece of the Milky Way for any of the Galaxy\u2019s structure to affect the distribution, or because on the largest scales in the cosmos, there\u2019s no structure big enough to stand out. It would be like if you saw a very fuzzy, low-resolution image of little yellow dots on a green background, and you didn\u2019t know if you were looking at a close-up photo of the petals of a small bunch of yellow flowers, or an aerial shot of yellow bushes scattered across a field. If it were anything in the middle, you\u2019d see the shape of the bush, or a clump of bushes.",
                    "More like this",
                    "But from close enough in or far enough away, the yellow is scattered about pretty much everywhere. In the case of GRBs, we had good reason to think they weren\u2019t that nearby, which left cosmological distances as the only possibility.",
                    "GRBs are now thought to have two origins. A 'long' GRB occurs when a rapidly rotating massive star collapses on itself, creates a supernova, and in the process causes energetic jets of radiation to shoot out through the poles of the stellar remnant. A 'short' GRB is caused by two neutron stars, themselves remnants of dead stars, colliding. Long GRBs made the news in a spectacular way in early October when what may have been the brightest burst ever recorded lit up the cosmos with so much power that it temporarily blinded several satellites and altered radio wave transmission by disturbing the Earth\u2019s ionosphere.",
                    "Officially dubbed GRB221009A, it also created a striking set of concentric rings in X-ray images, due to the way the light from the explosion bounced off layers of cosmic dust. Preliminary analyses of the burst suggest the star was so massive that it became a black hole after the explosion, and follow-up observations have found an optical-light afterglow that appears to be associated with the supernova.",
                    "We don\u2019t know if the star was orbited by any planets before it went off. If it did have any planets, they would have been destroyed by the supernova, if not the burst itself. But a GRB can cause devastation far beyond its own solar system. Some estimates suggest that a planet in the path of the beam could be vaporised even 200 light years away, and impacts on an atmosphere could be felt even farther. There have been some hints that GRBs millions of years ago could have changed the chemistry of our own atmosphere enough to set off mass extinctions.",
                    "Should we be worried? Probably not. Of the 1,700 or so recorded GRBs, the closest was a billion light-years away, far too distant to be an issue for us. And as far as we can tell, no nearby stars are massive enough to be a threat, and we don\u2019t have reason to believe there are any close neutron star pairs in danger of colliding soon, either.",
                    "As astronomers, we\u2019re grateful for GRBs: they help us learn exactly how and why stars explode in such a spectacular way. They also give us a useful probe of the cosmic material between us and them, by shining a very bright backlight on it.",
                    "Some theorists have even suggested that GRB221009A\u2019s most energetic photons might only have reached us with the help of exotic hypothetical particles called axions. As we keep watching for new GRBs, we\u2019ll have more data to help settle some of these questions, and fortunately, we don\u2019t have to get a close-up look.",

They can also communicate, show signs of spatial learning, and use tools to solve problems. They\u2019re so smart, they can even get bored.",
                    "It\u2019s no secret what makes it possible: Cephalopods have the most complex brains of any invertebrates on the planet. What remains mysterious, however, is the process. Basically, scientists have long wondered how cephalopods get their big brains in the first place?",

                    "\u201cOur conclusions were surprising because a lot of what we know about nervous system development in vertebrates has long been thought to be special to that lineage,\u201d said Kristen Koenig, a John Harvard Distinguished Fellow and senior author of the study.",
                    "\u201cBy observing the fact that the process is very similar, what it suggested to us is that these two independently evolved very large nervous systems are using the same mechanisms to build them. What that suggests is that those mechanisms \u2014 those tools \u2014 the animals use during development may be important for building big nervous systems.\u201d",
                    "The scientists from the Koenig Lab focused on the retina of a squid called Doryteuthis pealeii, more simply known as a type of longfin squid. The squid grow to be about a foot long and are abundant in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. As embryos the look quite adorable with big head and big eyes.",
                    "The researchers used similar techniques to those made popular to study model organisms, like fruit flies and zebrafish. They created special tools and used cutting edge microscopes that could take high resolution images every ten minutes for hours on end to see how individual cells behave. The researchers used florescent dyes to mark the cells so they could map them and track them.",
                    "This live-imaging technique allowed the team to observe stem cells called neural progenitor cells and how they are organized. The cells form a special kind of structure called a pseudostratified epithelium. Its main feature is the cells are elongated so they can be densely packed.",
                    "The researchers also saw the nucleus of these structures move up and down before and after dividing. This movement is important for keeping the tissue organized and growth continuing, they said.",

Image is in the public domain",
                    "This type of structure is universal in how vertebrate species develop their brain and eyes. Historically, it was considered one of the reasons the vertebrate nervous system could grow so large and complex. Scientists have observed examples of this type of neural epithelium in other animals, but the squid tissue they looked at in this instance was unusually similar to vertebrate tissues in its size, organization and the way the nucleus moved.",

                    "In a letter sent to ministers, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), UKHospitality, techUK, and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC) said the government was \u201cholding back investment\u201d in critical training that could increase productivity, fuel economic growth and raise wages.",
                    "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents most major retailers, said: \u201cThe government must urgently fix this \u00a33.5bn mistake, or it risks letting the UK\u2019s anaemic productivity trail further behind its international counterparts.",
                    "\u201cRetailers want to invest more in training a higher skilled, more productive and better-paid workforce. They want to create more opportunities for people up and down the country. They want to contribute more to growth. But the broken apprenticeship system is a ball and chain around their efforts.\u201d",
                    "Under the current system firms contribute hundreds of millions of pounds into a pot, which can be spent only on very specific types of training. For example, businesses cannot use the money to fund any courses that are shorter than one year in duration. They say this has left them unable to spend \u00a33.5bn of funds set aside.",
                    "Introduced in April 2017, the apprenticeship levy makes large organisations set aside 0.5% of their payroll for apprenticeships.",
                    "However, many employers say they are unable to use the funds \u2013 which are taken by the Treasury if not used within two years. A report by the Resolution Foundation warned of an explosion in the number of pricey, high-level apprenticeships for people already in work that could \u201ccrowd out\u201d youngsters.",
                    "The trade bodies want the government to widen the apprenticeship levy into a broader skills levy that can be spent on a broader range of accredited courses including shorter, more targeted courses.",
                    "Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said an overhaul of the system would help bring those who had become economically inactive, including ove-50s, back into work to plug skills gaps.",
                    "\u201cHospitality businesses are eager to invest more in developing the skills, training and development of their workforce, particularly when vacancies are so high. Reform of the apprenticeship levy is urgently needed to offer greater flexibility to businesses, particularly in how funding is used.\u201d",
                    "Julian David, the chief executive of techUK, said: \u201cThere is a real need to continue to support young people and new entrants into the workforce using apprenticeships, but also to support those in the existing workforce to progress and acquire the skills they need for the future of work. The key to this will be to reform the apprenticeship levy to make it flexible and fit-for-purpose.\u201d",

                    "\u201cSo far we\u2019ve supported more than 5 million apprenticeship starts in over 650 high-quality standards, ensuring whatever your career goals they can be achieved through an apprenticeship, and we\u2019re going further boosting funding to \u00a32.7bn by 2024-25. We are rolling out and expanding T levels, Institutes of Technology, and skill boot camps \u2013 all backed by \u00a33.8bn,\u201d Halfon said.",

                    "But tensions have become so heightened at one depot in south Manchester that drivers were involved in a stand-off with bosses this week. They say they 'grafted hard' over Christmas to help clear a huge backlog of parcels, but claim the 'tipping point' came when changes to their routes were implemented. Evri say they are in discussion with a 'small number' of couriers affected.",

                    "Evri say that when petrol costs spiked they introduced an additional fuel payment, which was 'tailored for round types.' But Craig says for him, this only amounted to an extra \u00a38 a month.",

                    "Several couriers at the south Manchester depot said the backlog of Christmas parcels, which totalled around 16,000 at their depot alone, was only cleared days ago. Evri say they hired an extra 5,000 staff over the festive period to help clear the backlog.",
                    "Another driver, who has worked for Evri for several years, says it's the 'worst job he's ever had,' but claims he's found it impossible to find work elsewhere. The courier, whose name has been changed to Richard, told the M.E.N he 'works hard for not a lot of money.'",
                    "\"Everyone is always just thinking 'oh my parcel is late' but it's not that simple. We have to manually load our car and then walk around the houses come rain or shine,\" he said.",

                    "Richard says most of the customers he deals with are understanding, but that a select few make life very difficult. \"The majority of people we deal with are okay but some of them are so demanding,\" he said.",

                    "\"At the depot we are left completely to the elements. If it's raining we are just open to the elements and all the parcels get wet. Evri doesn't care about us, it's just like it or lump it.",

                    "They claim they won't be able to survive on this and there were chaotic scenes outside the unit in Wythenshawe last week, as a group of angry couriers refused to pick up parcels as they demanded answers over what was happening.",
                    "Craig said the move by Evri had left some workers 'in tears.' He said his own round had been affected by the change, and that one large housing estate had been removed from his round, and another area he'd never covered before was added in.

                    "The author is chief executive of Barclays and is writing in a personal capacity for World Cancer Day",
                    "I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer, in November 2022, around the time of my first anniversary as the chief executive of Barclays, the global bank. My first reaction was to understand the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, worry about the new burdens on my family and arrange my medical care. Then, as a chief executive, I had to consider public disclosure and managing my job through treatment.",
                    "Disclosure was the easy part \u2014 with my physician\u2019s advice, I was able to convey the diagnosis and prospects. The response from LinkedIn was overwhelming.",
                    "The doctors said I could work through most of the treatment. This raised two uncomfortably clarifying questions: how should I spend my time and where would I add the greatest value?",
                    "In thinking about it this way, though, I made my first mistake. In this article I wanted to share what I learnt from my experience in working with cancer, both professionally and personally.",
                    "Be prepared to explain your choices",
                    "To my great surprise, a significant minority among many messages of support questioned my choice to work at all during treatment. They wondered whether this was a form of privilege, with my role affording me a flexibility denied to many others. Some even asked if it was CEO swagger or, worse, \u201cnegative virtue signalling\u201d, implying that it was wrong for others to take complete medical leave to heal themselves. Others felt that my apparent unwillingness to \u201clet go\u201d was a problem.",
                    "Cancer is of course a broad disease, and treatments vary. Mine placed relatively manageable demands on my time and energy. With other treatments, my decision might well have been different. I wanted to work because I enjoy it. I quickly clarified that the decision to work was mine alone, and neither Barclays nor I would ever expect others to do the same if they were unwilling, or unable. My choices were neither a model nor requirement for others, and though they were the right ones for me, I wish I had been more sensitive at the outset to this perception.",
                    "Draw the lines quickly",
                    "Barclays is a large organisation, employing about 90,000 people worldwide, processing millions of customer transactions daily, large and small. The reality is that all of this happens anyway without my direct engagement and I could leave well enough alone. On the other hand, I must attend to important operational and business decisions, including the investments which keep these transactions processed smoothly. There are many things in between, though, and I found it useful quickly to lay down some principles on what mattered for the time being.",
                    "Use absence to make the management team grow stronger",
                    "You have to let go and have total trust in your colleagues to handle the responsibilities you are relinquishing temporarily. Senior executive teams comprise high-achieving, opinionated leaders \u2014 that is what got them there. Shelves of management books advise on building cohesive teams who work perfectly together, with a shared vision. In reality, teamwork is always a work in progress. If it were so easy to do in practice, these books would not exist.",
                    "However, human situations and our unexpected difficulties \u2014 gratifyingly \u2014 do tend to accelerate the cohesion. I was confident, having worked with my colleagues for a number of years, that they would step into any gaps and that I would feel rewarded by their increased ownership of business strategy and execution.",
                    "Preserve the personal touch",
                    "During my few months of treatment, I needed to remain out of the office, unable to drop by our branches, visit regional locations, wander on to trading floors, chat to colleagues in cafeterias, lobbies and lifts, or to join client meetings. I always knew I would miss the constant contact and sought to remain accessible and responsive on email, and I never stopped calling colleagues and clients. All this may not have been necessary but I enjoyed it: it is important not just to do what you need but also what you like.",
                    "Less \u2018doing time\u2019 is not a cost",
                    "This is the area where I have struggled the most. It has been a habit of a working lifetime to take the frequent pulse of markets, of our business activity and of progress across many projects. In doing so, I took in a vast amount of information and expected to sift the signal from the noise. Now, with fewer occasions to probe colleagues, I had to decide which questions mattered \u2014 and when I should engage with them. It is a habit I should have cultivated more carefully earlier.",
                    "More \u2018thinking time\u2019 is a benefit",
                    "An advantage of a slightly lighter schedule and relative confinement is that I have been able to be more contemplative about my role. I think my comparative advantage to the firm is to be a more strategic and deliberative leader, engaging less frequently but more thoughtfully, and relying more on my colleagues.",
                    "Seek mental wellbeing and normality",
                    "As anyone who has had a cancer diagnosis will know, there are many deeply intense personal and emotional aspects to one\u2019s illness which of course outweigh the professional issues. Fundamentally, going through treatment for cancer is a struggle between short-term suffering and the expectation of long-term health. Our emotional happiness, physical wellbeing and friendships are affected by the disease, the treatments and the social restrictions resulting from weakened health and immunity. These human qualities are, however, precisely what we need to help us endure the treatment.",
                    "Encouraging mental wellbeing is an acknowledged part of modern cancer treatment. Even when in perfect health, our equanimity is taxed by endless stresses. Chemotherapy regimens, which create euphoric highs followed by melancholic lows, do not help. Luckily, these lows are shortlived and relatively predictable. Both the swings and the deeper malaise, I found, are best countered by continuing those activities which naturally bring me happiness and relaxation, such as sleep, yoga and TV.",
                    "Even if the body does not feel fine, physical activity is essential to create a sense of normality. A temporary lift of energy reminds us of what was, and what will be. A tip which many others gave me, and I followed, is to talk to nursing and clinical staff about how to manage the treatment \u2014 minimising its side effects on the body brings great joy!",
                    "Our sources of support and human connection come mostly from those closest to us: family, friends and colleagues. There is nothing more helpful and indeed, as Shakespeare tells us, \u201cit blesseth him that gives and him that takes\u201d.",
                    "I was also blessed with encouragement from some unexpected sources: two chief executives with family and personal experience of lymphoma; the sister of a colleague who, while bravely enduring her own struggles, has formed a refreshingly original and positive view of life; most inspirationally, a note from a colleague\u2019s young son, who had recently overcome medulloblastoma following a brutal treatment at five years old.",
                    "Individuals who receive a cancer diagnosis should decide for themselves whether they are able and willing to work during treatment \u2014 and should be able to change their minds. Whatever they choose, they may find that cancer also gives one opportunities: to build resilience, gain empathy, strengthen old friendships and make new ones, and above all, increase self-awareness.",
                    "For this hope and choice, we should all be enormously grateful to the scientific and medical community."

In days gone by, when DSLRs reigned, you could pick up a decent starter kit for 500 bucks easily. But now brands like Canon and Nikon are refusing to issue licenses to third-party lens manufacturers \u2013 which could mean bye-bye to affordable alternatives on modern mirrorless bodies.",
                    "Since Canon first launched its mirrorless RF mount with the Canon EOS R , it has maintained complete authority over what third-party autofocus lenses can be manufactured. This means that if you\u2019re looking for a cheaper version of the official Canon RF 24-70mm f/2.8L IS USM (opens in new tab), bad luck \u2013 you won\u2019t find one. For whatever reason, Canon refuses to license any autofocus lenses by third parties \u2013 which is why you don't see anything from the likes of Sigma.",

                    "On one hand, I can completely understand why Nikon would make this move. After all, what company would want a product they have meticulously designed and manufactured to be ruined by a lens that hasn\u2019t been created with the same high-quality parts or technical know-how?",
                    "However, brands like Sigma, Samyang and Tamron are known for making high-quality, high-precision optics that in lab tests fair very well, even against some of the first-party lenses. So it does make you wonder, is it a profit thing\u2026",
                    "One of the main reasons Nikon and Canon have gone down this route could be that they don\u2019t want any competition. Simple supply and demand economics means that if it isn\u2019t available elsewhere, people will have to buy an official RF or Z mount lens \u2013 which means that Nikon and Canon can set and maintain prices. This is bad news for people who invested in these systems and held out hopes for cheaper third-party lens options.",
                    "Another reason could be due patent and design copyright infringement. Shortly after Viltrox launched the 85mm f/1.8 lens, many third-party Canon RF-fit lenses were pulled from sale. All mention of it vanished and the company issued a statement saying, \"We have been told by Canon to stop selling all RF mount products, so we will not release RF-related information on the official website\". Samyang experienced a similar issue, and with Nikon following suit it looks like third-party brands are going to have to get more creative with the lenses they design.",
                    "However, third-party lens manufacturers have found ways around these stringent measures, by creating lenses that are similar but not the same. Tamron for example released the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III RXD lens for Sony E mount, while Sigma\u2019s answer came in the form of the Sigma 28-70mm f/2.8 DG DN (opens in new tab) \u2013 both very well-made, well-respected lenses that offer decent optical quality at a vastly lower cost.",
                    "I hope for Nikon and Canon\u2019s sake that they do open up licenses for these types of alternative 'standards', because otherwise they could see a lot of people making the jump to different brands who will grant licenses to pre-existing lens designs.",

                    "Like most Shooting Brake models, the front end remains largely identical to the standard Coupe and the changes only really start from behind the doors. The roof has been stretched and there is now a particularly sleek-looking C-pillar that suits the overall design of the car absolutely perfectly.",
                    "We think the LC Shooting Brake looks especially good from the rear three-quarter view where the re-shaped roofline, the C-pillar, and the revised fascia immediately catch the eye.",
                    "It goes without saying that a Lexus LC Shooting Brake will likely never come to fruition unless one is built by an aftermarket firm or coachbuilder. That\u2019s a shame as such a model would help to broaden the appeal of the LC and could boost sales."

                    "There is no shortage of standard zoom lenses \u2013 though what constitutes the \"standard\" is being continually challenged by manufacturers, the latest of which is Tamron.",
                    "The best standard zoom lenses (opens in new tab) are ubiquitous, with almost every new camera in the last few decades coming with the option of an 18-55mm or 24-105mm kit lens. If that doesn't satisfy, then the go-to zoom lens upgrade for pro photographers for eons has been the trusty 24-70mm f/2.8.",
                    "In the last few years, lens makers keep messing with this formula, whether it is Sony announcing its latest standard zoom with a wider wide end, the Sony FE 20-70mm f/4 G (opens in new tab), or Canon releasing the colossal bokeh beast that is the Canon RF 28-70mm f/2L USM (opens in new tab).",
                    "Tamron, one of the most prolific third-party lens manufacturers, has decided to very much plant its flag in the ground of weird standard zoom lengths. Seemingly now just throwing darts at a board and seeing what it hits, it has recently made the unusual, but actually very impressive Tamron 28-75mm F/2.8 Di III VXD G2 (opens in new tab), Tamron 17-70mm F/2.8 Di III-A VC RXD (opens in new tab) and Tamron 35-150mm F/2-2.8 Di III VXD (opens in new tab).",
                    "Things get even more complicated when you add in APS-C crop sensors that actually multiply all those focal length numbers by 1.5x (or 1.6x if you are a Canon shooter).",
                    "Now Asobinet has uncovered a new patent for a Tamron 28-100mm f/2.8 lens, which sounds like the natural evolution of the 28-75mm lens mentioned above. If a new 28-100mm lens can manage to keep roughly the same dimensions and weight as the 28-75mm and maintain its optical quality, then this could be a very very exciting lens for travel photographers and those who hate carrying multiple lenses.",
                    "New mechanics are only going to make new and interesting optical formulas more common. As technology improves electronic components are becoming smaller and smaller, with autofocus motors and the chips that drive them taking up less space in a lens. New manufacturing techniques and new materials also enable lenses to be thinner and lighter while actually being stronger and more durable.",

                    "When you\u2019re looking to upgrade your home theatre setup with a brand new 4K laser projector, don\u2019t do what I did and forget to read its spec sheet first, or you might be in for a nasty surprise.",
                    "I adore projectors and think that people should at least consider ditching their TV for one. Sure, the best 4K projectors are typically pricier than the best 4K TVs, and you have to ensure your home theater is constructed in the right room \u2013 somewhere with a big white surface and no windows (or black-out curtains installed) \u2013 for the best visuals. But the atmosphere produced by a projector-fuelled setup and the view-filling images it can create is well worth the effort, in my eyes.",
                    "So, in my crusade to convince others that projectors are the way forward, I took the Epson EH-LS11000W that I\u2019ve been testing for TechRadar to my parents\u2019 place to show them what it was capable of. In my review, I was really impressed by the laser projector\u2019s crisp 4K image (which can be blown up to a size of 300 inches) and its picture\u2019s splendid colors \u2013 though the contrast in dark scenes isn\u2019t as good as I\u2019d have liked (especially for its price), plus its limited ports and lack of TV OS is a bad combination as you have to waste a port on a streaming stick.",
                    "In addition, as I learned at my parents\u2019 house after spending a few hours hyping it up and getting it set up, it lacks any in-built speakers. This realization brought movie night to an instant halt, as my family was not keen to let me borrow their soundbar and ruin their existing TV setup. So I dejectedly returned the EH-LS11000W to its box. TV one, projector zero.",
                    "Right projector, wrong home theatre",
                    "This isn\u2019t actually that uncommon for projectors; even fairly high-cost options like the Epson EH-LS11000W (which will set you back $3,999 / \u00a34,199 / around AU$5,750) focus their efforts on producing stellar visuals and leave audio to the best soundbars and best speakers.",
                    "But in my hubris, I forgot this. Instead, I assumed the vents on the side of the machine were so its speakers could emit clear audio, neglecting to think that they could in fact be vents for its 2,5000 lumens laser setup to dissipate heat.",
                    "Thankfully, I hadn\u2019t spent any money on this projector as Epson is loaning it to me for the review so the mistake didn\u2019t cost me. If I had just dropped $3,999 / \u00a34,199, then that would've been my entire home theater budget down the drain on an incomplete setup.",
                    "But this moment is a good reminder that even we techies can make mistakes and assume things about a cool-looking product that aren\u2019t accurate. That\u2019s why we always recommend reading through a gadget\u2019s capabilities and reviews before buying it (and don\u2019t just look at the score and move on).",
                    "Speakerless projectors like the Epson EH-LS11000W aren\u2019t terrible, but they\u2019re not suited to every home theater setup. That\u2019s the case for a lot of tech; it\u2019s not about how amazing the appliance is, it's about whether it's great for you and your needs."
